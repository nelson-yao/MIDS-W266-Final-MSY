Notice of Transaction
 
(iii) . In the event the requirements of Section 2(c) of this Article IV are not complied with, the Corporation shall forthwith either cause the closing of the transaction to be postponed until such time as the requirements of Section 2(c) of this Article IV have been complied with, or cancel such transaction, in which event the rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of the Preferred Stock shall revert to and be the same as such rights, preferences and privileges existing immediately prior to the date of the first notice referred to in Section 2(c)(ii) of this Article IV.
Effect of Noncompliance

4. . The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as set forth in this Section 4 (the "Conversion Rights"). The shares of Preferred Stock shall be convertible into shares of Class B Common Stock, as set forth in this Section 4.
Conversion
 
(a) . Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for such stock. Each share of Series A or Series A-1 Preferred shall be convertible into the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Class B Common Stock, which results from dividing the per share Series A Conversion Value (as hereinafter defined) by the Series A Conversion Price (as hereinafter defined) per share in effect at the time of conversion. Each share of Series B or Series B-1 Preferred shall be convertible into the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Class B Common Stock, which results from dividing the per share Series B Conversion Value (as hereinafter defined) by the Series B Conversion Price (as hereinafter defined) per share in effect at the time of conversion. Each share of Series C or Series C-1 Preferred shall be convertible into the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Class B Common Stock, as the case may be, which results from dividing the per share Series C Conversion Value (as hereinafter defined) by the Series C Conversion Price (as hereinafter defined) per share in effect at the time of conversion. Each share of Series D or Series D-1 Preferred shall be convertible into the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Class B Common Stock, which results from dividing the per share Series D Conversion Value (as hereinafter defined) by the Series D Conversion Price (as hereinafter defined) per share in effect at the time of conversion. The per share price as of the date of the filing of this Certificate at which shares of Class B Common Stock shall be deliverable upon conversion of the Series A or Series A-1 Preferred (the "Conversion Price" for each of the Series A and Series A-1 Preferred) shall be $0.0625, and the per share conversion value attributable to the Series A or Series A-1 Preferred shall be $0.0625 (the "Conversion Value" for each of the Series A and Series A-1 Preferred). The per share price as of the date of the filing of this Certificate at which shares of Class B Common Stock shall be deliverable upon conversion of the Series B or Series B-1 Preferred (the "Conversion Price" for each of the Series B and Series B-1 Preferred) shall be $0.49525, and the per share conversion value attributable to the Series B or Series B-1 Preferred shall be $0.49525 (the "Conversion Value" for each of the Series B and Series B-1 Preferred). The per share price as of the date of the filing of this Certificate at which shares of Class B Common Stock shall be deliverable upon conversion of the Series C or Series C-1 Preferred (the "Conversion Price" for each of the Series C and Series C-1 Preferred) shall be $2.3425 and the per share conversion value attributable to the Series C or Series C-1 Preferred shall be $2.3425 (the "Conversion Value" for each of the Series C and Series C-1 Preferred). The per share price as of the date of the filing of this Certificate at which shares of Class B Common Stock shall be deliverable upon conversion of the Series D or Series D-1 Preferred (the "Conversion Price" for the Series D and Series D-1 Preferred) shall be $2.91 and the per share conversion value attributable to the Series D or Series D-1 Preferred shall be $2.91 (the "Conversion Value" for the Series D and Series D-1 Preferred). The Conversion Price for each of the Series A, Series A-1, Series B, Series B-1, Series C, Series C-1, Series D and Series D-1 Preferred shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided below. The number of shares of Class B Common Stock into which a share of a series of Preferred Stock is convertible is hereinafter referred to as the "Conversion Rate" for such share.
Right to Convert
 
(b) . Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into shares of Class B Common Stock at its then effective Conversion Rate immediately prior to the closing of the sale of Common Stock of the Corporation in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, covering the offering and sale of Common Stock for the account of the Corporation to the public (an "IPO") at a price per share (prior to underwriter commissions and offering expenses) of not less than $2.3425 (appropriately adjusted for Recapitalizations) and at an aggregate offering price to the public of not less than $15,000,000. In the event of the automatic conversion of the Preferred Stock upon a public offering as described above, the person(s) entitled to receive the Class B Common Stock issuable upon such conversion of Preferred Stock shall not be deemed to have converted such Preferred Stock until immediately prior to the closing of the IPO. Each share of Preferred Stock also shall be automatically converted into shares of Class B Common Stock, at its then effective Conversion Rate upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of Preferred Stock.
Automatic Conversion
 
(c) . Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into shares of Class B Common Stock and receive certificates therefor, he shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that such holder elects to convert the same; provided, however, that in the event of an automatic conversion pursuant to Section 4(b) of this Article IV, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent, and provided further that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Class B Common Stock, issuable upon such automatic conversion unless the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are either delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after such delivery, or such agreement and indemnification in the case of a lost certificate, issue and deliver at such office to such holder of Preferred Stock, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Class B Common Stock, to which the holder shall be entitled as aforesaid and a check payable to the holder in the amount of any cash amounts payable as the result of a conversion into fractional shares of Class B Common Stock, as the case may be, as set forth in Section 4(i) of this Article IV. Such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Preferred Stock to be converted, or in the case of automatic conversion as provided in Section 4(b) of this Article IV, such conversion shall be deemed to occur as set forth in Section 4(b) of this Article IV, and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Class B Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Class B Common Stock on such date.
Mechanics of Conversion

No Adjustment for Conversion Price
 
(iii) . In the event the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the date of filing of this Certificate shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities then entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible Securities, then the maximum number of shares (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto without regard to any provisions contained therein designed to protect against dilution) of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor, the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be Additional Shares of Common Stock issued as of the time of such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, provided that in any such case in which Additional Shares of Common Stock are deemed to be issued:
Deemed Issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock
 
(A) no further adjustment in any Conversion Price shall be made upon the subsequent issue of the Options or Convertible Securities or shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities;
 
(B) if such Options or Convertible Securities by their terms provide, with the passage of time or otherwise, for any increase or decrease in the consideration payable to the Corporation, or decrease or increase in the number of shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock issuable, upon the exercise, conversion or exchange thereof, the Conversion Price computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon any such increase or decrease becoming effective, be recomputed to reflect such increase or decrease insofar as it affects such Options or the rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities (provided, however, that no such adjustment of any Conversion Price shall affect Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock previously issued upon conversion of the Preferred Stock, if any);
 
(C) upon the expiration of any such Options or any rights of conversion or exchange under such Convertible Securities which shall not have been exercised, the Conversion Price computed upon the original issue thereof (or upon the occurrence of a record date with respect thereto), and any subsequent adjustments based thereon, shall, upon such expiration, be recomputed as if:
 
(1) in the case of Convertible Securities or Options, the only Additional Shares of Common Stock issued were the shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, if any, actually issued upon the exercise of such Options or the Conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities and the consideration received therefor was the consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration actually
 
received by the Corporation upon such exercise, or for the issue of all such Convertible Securities which were actually converted or exchanged, plus the additional consideration, if any, actually received by the Corporation upon such conversion or exchange; and
 
(2) in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, only the Convertible Securities, if any, actually issued upon the exercise thereof were issued at the time of issue of such Options, and the consideration received by the Corporation for the Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been then issued was the consideration actually received by the Corporation for the issue of all such Options, whether or not exercised, plus the consideration deemed to have been received by the Corporation (determined pursuant to Section 4(d)(v) of this Article IV) upon the issue of the Convertible Securities with respect to which such Options were actually exercised;
 
(D) no readjustment pursuant to clause (B) or (C) above shall have the effect of increasing any Conversion Price to an amount which exceeds the lower of (a) the Conversion Price on the original adjustment date, or (b) the Conversion Price that would have resulted from any issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock between the original adjustment date and such readjustment date.
 
(iv) .
Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock
 
(A) In the event the Corporation, at any time after the date of the filing of this Certificate, shall issue Additional Shares of Common Stock (including Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(iii) of this Article IV) without consideration or for consideration per share less than the Conversion Price of the Series A, Series B, Series C or Series D Preferred Stock, as applicable, in effect on the date of and immediately prior to such issue, then and in such event, the Conversion Price of such Series A, Series B, Series C or Series D Preferred Stock, as applicable, shall be reduced, concurrently with such issue, to the Conversion Price (calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent) determined by dividing (X) an amount equal to the sum of (1) the product derived by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issue or sale times the number of shares of Common Stock Outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to such issue or sale, plus (2) the consideration, if any, received by the Corporation upon such issue or sale, by (Y) an amount equal to the sum of (1) the number of shares of Common Stock Outstanding immediately prior to such issue or sale, plus (2) the number of shares of Additional Shares of Common Stock issued or deemed to have been issued in such issue and sale. For the purposes of the calculations set forth in this Section 4(d)(iv), the number of shares of "Common Stock Outstanding" at any time shall be equal to the number of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock outstanding at such time plus the number of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock issuable upon the exercise and/or conversion of all Options and Convertible Securities then outstanding.
 
(B) From and after such time as any share of Series A-1 Preferred is issued and outstanding, the Conversion Price for the Series A-1 Preferred shall be the Series A Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance and shall not thereafter be subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 4(d)(iv)(A) of this Article IV. From and after such time as any share of Series B-1 Preferred is issued and outstanding, the Conversion Price for the Series B-1 Preferred shall be the Series B Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance and shall not thereafter be subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 4(d)(iv)(A) of this Article IV. From and after such time as any share of Series C-1 Preferred is issued and outstanding, the Conversion Price for the Series C-1 Preferred shall be the Series C Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance and shall not thereafter be subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 4(d)(iv)(A) of this Article IV. From and after such time as any share of Series D-1 Preferred is issued and outstanding, the Conversion Price for the Series D-1 Preferred shall be the Series D Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance and shall not thereafter be subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 4(d)(iv)(A) of this Article IV.
 
(v) . The consideration per share received by the Corporation for Additional Shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued pursuant to Section 4(d)(iii) of this Article IV, relating to Options and Convertible Securities shall be determined by dividing:
Determination of Consideration for Options and Convertible Securities
 
(A) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the issue of such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein designed to protect against dilution, but excluding any cash received on account of accrued interest or accrued dividends) payable to the Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities by
 
(B) the maximum number of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein designed to protect against the dilution) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities.
 
If the consideration is not cash or such instrument does not specify the value of the additional consideration such consideration shall be deemed to be the fair value thereof as determined by the Board of Directors irrespective of any accounting treatment.
 
(e) . In the event the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, stock dividend, stock combination, reclassification or otherwise) at any time after the filing of this Certificate into a greater number of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased. In the event the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall be combined or consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination or consolidation, be proportionately increased.
Adjustments for Subdivisions, Combinations or Consolidation of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock
 
(f) . If the shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any shares of Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock or other securities or property, whether by reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares provided for in Section 4(e) of this Article IV), the Conversion Price for each series then in effect shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such reorganization or reclassification, be proportionately adjusted such that the shares of Preferred Stock shall be convertible into, in lieu of the number of shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock which the holders thereof would otherwise have been entitled to receive upon such conversion, a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock or other securities or property equivalent to the number of shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, as the case may be, that would have been issuable to the holders of Preferred Stock if their shares of Preferred Stock had been converted immediately before such change; and, in any such case, appropriate adjustment (as determined by the Board of Directors) shall be made in the application of the provisions herein set forth with respect to the rights and interest thereafter of the holders of Preferred Stock, to
Adjustments for Reorganization, Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution
 
the end that the provisions set forth herein (including the provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the applicable Conversion Price) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any shares of stock or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the Preferred Stock.
 
(g) . In the event the Corporation shall declare a distribution payable in securities of other persons, evidences of indebtedness issued by the Corporation or other persons, assets (excluding cash dividends) or options or rights not referred to in Section 4(e) of this Article IV, then, in each such case for the purpose of this Section 4(g), the holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to a proportionate share of any such distribution as though they were the holders of the number of shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock of the Corporation into which their shares of Preferred Stock are convertible as of the record date fixed for the determination of the holders of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, as the case may be, of the Corporation entitled to receive such distribution.
Other Distributions
 
(h) . The Corporation will not through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of Section 4 of this Article IV and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the Conversion Rights of the holders of Preferred Stock against impairment. This provision shall not restrict the Corporation's right to amend its Certificate with the requisite stockholder consent.
No Impairment
 
(i) . No fractional shares of Class B Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then fair market value of a share of Class B Common Stock, as the case may be, as determined by the Board of Directors. For such purpose, all shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder of Preferred Stock shall be aggregated, and any resulting fractional share of Class B Common Stock shall be paid in cash. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 4 of this Article IV, the Corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and prepare and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Corporation shall, upon written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i) all such adjustments and readjustments, (ii) the Conversion Price for such series at the time in effect, and (iii) the number of shares of Class B Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of such holder's shares of Preferred Stock.
No Fractional Shares and Certificate as to Adjustments
 
(j) . In the event of any taking by the Corporation of a record of the holders of any class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who are entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, the Corporation shall mail to each holder of Preferred Stock, at least ten (10) days prior to the date specified therein, a notice specifying the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right.
Notices of Record Date
 
(k) . The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Class B Common Stock solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of Preferred Stock such number of its shares of Class
Reservation of Common Stock Issuable Upon Conversion
 
B Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Class B Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Class B Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.
 
(l) . Any notice required by the provisions of Section 4 of this Article IV to be given to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed given three (3) days after deposit in the United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of record at his address appearing on the books of the Corporation.
Notices
 
5. . Until such time as all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock have been converted to Class B Common Stock pursuant to the provisions set forth in Article IV, Section 4(b) of this Certificate and in addition to any other rights provided by law, the Corporation shall not, without first obtaining the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of not less than a majority of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class:
Protective Covenants
 
(a) amend or repeal any provision of, or add any provision to, the Corporation's Certificate or Bylaws if such action would materially or adversely alter or change the preferences, rights, privileges or powers of, or the restrictions provided for the benefit of the Preferred Stock, or increase or decrease the number of shares of Preferred Stock authorized hereby;
 
(b) authorize or issue or obligate itself to issue, shares of any class or series of stock having any preference or priority as to voting, dividends or upon liquidation which are superior to any such preference or priority of the Preferred Stock;
 
(c) authorize or issue shares of stock of any class or series of any bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations convertible into or exchangeable for, or having option rights to purchase, any shares of stock of this Corporation having any preference or priority as to voting, dividends or upon liquidation which are superior to any such preference or priority of the Preferred Stock;
 
(d) reclassify any class or series of any Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock into shares having any preference or priority as to voting, dividends or upon liquidation which are superior to any such preference or priority any series of Preferred Stock;
 
(e) effect a transaction described in Section 2(c) of this Article IV; or
 
(f) increase or decrease (other than by redemption or conversion) the total number of authorized shares of Series A, Series A-1, Series B, Series B-1, Series C, Series C-1, Series D or Series D-1 Preferred Stock.
 
6. . In the event any shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted pursuant to Section 4 of this Article IV, the shares so converted shall be cancelled and shall not be issuable by the Corporation. The Certificate shall be appropriately amended to effect the corresponding reduction in the Corporation's authorized capital stock.
Status of Converted Stock
 
7. .
Special Mandatory Conversion
 
(a) If, at any time following the Original Issue Date of the Series C Preferred and until such time as all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock have been converted to Class B Common Stock pursuant to the provisions set forth in Article IV, Section 4(b) of this Certificate, (i) each and every holder of Series A, Series B, Series C and Series D Preferred Stock has a Right of First Offer with respect to an equity financing by the Corporation (the "Equity Financing"), (ii) the Corporation has complied with its obligations with respect to the Right of First Offer relating to the Equity Financing, and (iii) any holder of shares of Series A, Series B, Series C or Series D Preferred Stock or any holder of securities convertible or exercisable for shares of Series D Preferred Stock does not by exercise of such holder's Right of First Offer acquire the amount of securities offered in such Equity Financing to which such holder is entitled pursuant to the Right of First Offer, then, effective immediately prior to the consummation of such Equity Financing, (A) if the Equity Financing was at a price per share less than the original issue price for the Series A Preferred Stock (as adjusted for Recapitalizations), then all of such holder's shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall automatically and without further action on the part of such holder be converted into an equivalent number of shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock, (B) if the Equity Financing was at a price per share less than the original issue price for the Series B Preferred Stock (as adjusted for Recapitalizations), then all of such holder's shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall automatically and without further action on the part of such holder be converted into an equivalent number of shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock, (C) if the Equity Financing was at a price per share less than the original issue price for the Series C Preferred Stock (as adjusted for Recapitalizations), then all such holder's shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall automatically and without further action on the part of such holder be converted into an equivalent number of shares of Series C-1 Preferred Stock, and (D) if the Equity Financing was at a price per share less than the original issue price for the Series D Preferred Stock (and, in the case securities convertible or exercisable for shares of Series D Preferred Stock were issued prior to the first issuance of any shares of Series D Preferred Stock, a price per share less than the original conversion or exercise price of the first such convertible or exercisable securities issued) (as adjusted for Recapitalizations), then all such holder's shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall automatically and without further action on the part of such holder be converted into an equivalent number of shares of Series D-1 Preferred Stock (and with respect to securities convertible or exercisable for shares of Series D Preferred Stock, all of such holder's securities convertible or exercisable for Series D Preferred Stock shall become convertible or exercisable into shares of Series D-1 Preferred Stock pursuant to their terms); provided, however, that no such conversion shall occur in connection with a particular Equity Financing if, pursuant to the written request of the Corporation, the Right of First Offer with respect to such Equity Financing is waived with respect to every holder of Series A, Series B, Series C and Series D Preferred Stock and securities convertible or exercisable for shares of Series D Preferred Stock. Upon conversion pursuant to this Section 7, the shares of Series A, Series B, Series C or Series D Preferred Stock so converted shall be canceled and not subject to reissuance. The "Agreement" means that certain Second Amended and Restated Co-Sale, Right of First Refusal and Right of First Offer Agreement among the Corporation, the holders of the Series A, Series B, Series C and Series D Preferred Stock, the holder of securities convertible or exercisable for shares of Series D Preferred Stock and certain founders of the Corporation, as such agreement may from time to time be amended. A "Right of First Offer" means the right to participate in a sale and issuance of equity securities (or securities convertible into or exercisable for equity securities of the Corporation) of the Corporation on a pro rata basis (according to Preferred Stock stockholdings and/or holdings of shares issuable upon exercise of warrants to purchase Series D Preferred); provided that, if a stockholder has a pro rata right to participate in an Equity Financing that calculates the pro rata right based on shares of Preferred Stock and/or shares issuable upon exercise of warrants to purchase Series D Preferred as well as shares of additional securities, options and/or rights held by the stockholder (such additional securities, options and/or rights, the "Additional Securities") such stockholder shall, be deemed to have a Right of First Offer because the stockholder has a right to participate based on shares of Preferred Stock and/or shares issuable upon exercise of warrants to purchase Series D Preferred held (notwithstanding that such stockholder has a right to participate based on the Additional Securities held), and, for purposes of this Section 7(a), the Right of First Offer shall mean that level of participation that is determined based on the shares of Preferred Stock and/or shares issuable upon exercise of warrants to purchase Series D Preferred that such stockholder holds.
 
(b) The holder of any shares of Series A, Series B, Series C or Series D Preferred Stock or securities convertible or exercisable for shares of Series D Preferred Stock converted pursuant to this Section 7 shall deliver to the Corporation during regular business hours at the office of any transfer agent of the Corporation for such series of Preferred Stock, or at such other place as may be designated by the Corporation, the certificate or certificates representing the shares or securities so converted, duly endorsed or assigned in blank or to the Corporation.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Company reports revenues of $805.9 million, up 105 percent year over year in first post-IPO quarter.
 
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  October 21, 2004  Google Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG) today announced financial results for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2004.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"We are very pleased with the results of this quarter. Record revenues, robust margins and cash generation all illustrated strong performance and execution over the last quarter," said Eric Schmidt, Google chief executive officer. "Our commitment to user and to the development of quality products and services for them clearly translated into robust financial results. That dedication to our users, combined with our relentless technology innovation and market opportunity make us very optimistic about our company's future."
Financial Highlights
 
Revenue in the quarter totaled a record $805.9 million, representing a 15 percent increase over the second quarter of 2004 and a 105 percent year-over-year gain. This revenue growth reflects strong traffic and monetization growth in the quarter as well as advertisers' growing recognition of the Internet as an effective advertising medium.
Revenue -
 
Google-owned sites generated $411.7 million or 51 percent of total revenue. This represents an increase of 99 percent over the third quarter of 2003.
Google-Sites Revenue
-
 
Revenue generated on Google's partner sites, through AdSense programs, contributed $384.3 million, or 48 percent of total revenue, a 120 percent increase over the Network revenue generated in the same quarter last year.
The Google Network
-
 
or the portion of revenue shared with Google's partners increased to $302.9 million or 79 percent of Google Network revenue. This compares to total payments to partners of $143.5 million in the third quarter of 2003, or 82 percent of Google Network revenue.
TAC  Traffic Acquisition Costs
 
Income from operations in the quarter, on a GAAP basis, totaled $11.1 million or 1.4 percent of revenue, and included a non-cash charge of $68.0 million for stock-based compensation as well as a non-cash, non-recurring charge of $201.0 million associated with the previously announced settlement of disputes with Yahoo. Without the non-recurring charge, income from operations would have been $212.1 million, or 26.3 percent of revenues as compared to $66.6 million or 16.9 percent of revenue in the same period of 2003. This improvement in operating margins, before the settlement of disputes with Yahoo, was primarily due to proportionately lower advertising revenue from Google Network members' sites, which resulted in lower traffic acquisition cost as a percentage of total revenue. A lower stock-based compensation charge, on a percentage basis, also contributed to the improvement.
Income from operations 
 
Google recorded a net income tax benefit of $37.0 million on its income statement in the third quarter compared to a $90.4 million provision for income taxes and a 53 percent effective tax rate last quarter, primarily as a result of a $46.0 million benefit recorded in the third quarter against the provision for income taxes related to certain stock-based compensation charges recognized prior to the IPO. This tax benefit was recorded as a result of our transformation from a private to a public company.
Income Taxes
 
Net income on a GAAP basis increased to $52.0 million or 6.5 percent of revenues in the third quarter as compared to $20.4 million or 5.2 percent of revenue in the third quarter of 2003. Earnings on a diluted per share basis were $0.19 as compared to $0.08 in the third quarter of 2003. Net income included the after tax effect of the non-cash and non-recurring settlement charge of $119.0 million and a tax benefit of $46.0 million related to certain stock-based compensation charges recognized prior to the IPO. Net income before these non-recurring items was $125.0 million, or $0.45 per share.
Net Income
 Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $608.9 million for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2004. Free cash flow is an alternative measure of liquidity to GAAP net cash provided by operating activities and is calculated as operating cash flows less capital expenditures. Free cash flow for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2004 totaled $349.0 million.
Operating and Free Cash Flow
 
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before the non-cash stock-based compensation charge, the non-cash and non-recurring settlement charge and in-process R&D. It is another alternative measure of liquidity to GAAP net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA increased by approximately $44 million or 16 percent to $321 million (or 40 percent of revenues) in the third quarter from $278 million (or 40 percent of revenues) in the second quarter. The reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to the GAAP measure of liquidity, net cash provided by operating activities, is set forth at the back of this release.
Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 At the end of the quarter, Google had a cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance of $1.86 billion.
Cash
 
On a worldwide basis, Google employed 2,668 full time employees as of Sept. 30, 2004, up from 2,292 as of June 30, 2004.
 
Webcast and conference call information

Forward looking statements
 
This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements relating to Google's market opportunity and future business prospects. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are included in Google's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and from time to time in other reports filed by Google with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
About non-GAAP financial measures.
 
To supplement Google's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, Google uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance and liquidity. These non-GAAP measures are comprised of income from operations, net income and net income per share before material non-recurring items, as well as free cash flows and adjusted EBITDA. Google's management believes that income from operations before material non-recurring items and net income before material non-recurring items provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the company's core operating results because
they exclude amounts that are not necessarily related to those core results and are of a non-recurring nature. Google's management believes that free cash flows and adjusted EBITDA provide meaningful supplemental information regarding liquidity. Google believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of Google's ongoing operations and liquidity and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Google's historical operating results and liquidity.
 
Google computes its non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. The accompanying tables have more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.

Item 8.01. Other Events
 
On September 15, 2004, Larry Page, Sergey Brin and Eric Schmidt each adopted stock trading plans in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Google's policies regarding stock transactions. In the future, they will begin selling a portion of their Google stock pursuant to these stock trading plans.
 
Larry Page is a Co-Founder of Google and serves as Google's President, Products and Sergey Brin is also a Co-Founder of Google and serves as its President, Technology. Dr. Eric Schmidt is Google's Chief Executive Officer.
 
These pre-arranged stock trading plans were adopted in order to allow Larry, Sergey and Eric to sell a portion of their Google stock over time as part of their respective long-term strategies for individual asset diversification and liquidity. The transactions under these plans will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 and Form 144 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Using these plans, they can gradually diversify their investment portfolios and can spread stock trades out over an extended period of time to reduce market impact. Because these plans were established well in advance of a trade, they also help avoid concerns about whether these officers had material, non-public information when they made a decision to sell their stock.
 
Larry, Sergey and Eric currently hold approximately 90.5 million shares of Class B common stock, which represents approximately 33.0% of Google's outstanding capital stock and approximately 45.7% of the voting power of Google's outstanding capital stock. Under the terms of these Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, and as a part of an 18 month diversification plan, Larry and Sergey each intend to sell approximately 7.2 million shares. If they complete all planned sales under these trading plans, they will retain approximately 81.1% of their current holdings of Google stock. Eric intends to sell approximately 2.2 million shares under his Rule 10b5-1 trading plans as a part of an 18 month diversification plan and if all planned sales under these trading plans are completed Eric will retain approximately 84.6% of his current holdings of Google stock. If Larry, Sergey and Eric complete all the planned sales under these Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, they would continue to collectively own approximately 73.9 million shares, which would represent approximately 27.0% of Google's outstanding capital stock and approximately 40.4% of the voting power of Google's outstanding capital stock (assuming no other sales and conversions of Google capital stock occur).
 
Each of our executive officers has also entered into Rule 10b5-1 trading plans in order to sell a portion of their Google stock. Sales made pursuant to these plans will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 and Form 144 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") deems it appropriate that cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act"), against respondents Google, Inc. ("Google") and David C. Drummond ("Drummond") (collectively "Respondents").
 
 
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Google and Drummond have submitted an Offer of Settlement ("Offer") which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission's jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of these proceedings, which are admitted, Respondents consent to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 ("Order"), as set forth below.
 
On the basis of this Order and Respondents' Offer, the Commission finds that:
 
A.
Summary
 
1. Google, a Silicon Valley search engine technology company, issued over $80 million worth of stock options to the company's employees and consultants from 2002 to 2004 without registering the offering and without providing financial information required to be disclosed under the federal securities laws. As a result, Google employees and other persons accepted Google securities as part of their compensation without certain detailed financial information about the company. By issuing the options without registering the offering and without the legally required disclosures, Google violated the securities registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act. As described below, Google's General Counsel, David C. Drummond, caused Google to violate these provisions.
 
B.
Respondents
 
2. Google, Inc. is a Delaware corporation with its principal executive offices located in Mountain View, California. Founded in 1998, Google is an Internet search engine technology provider. On April 29, 2004, Google filed a registration statement for an initial public offering of securities with the Commission, which became effective on August 19, 2004. The company's common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, and is quoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
 
3. David C. Drummond, age 41, resides in San Jose, California. Drummond is Google's General Counsel, Vice President of Corporate Development and Secretary. He is an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of California.

Facts
 
 
4. Under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, a company cannot offer or sell securities to the public without first registering the offering with the Commission or having a valid exemption from registration. Registration ensures that potential investors will have detailed information about the issuer's finances and business, and allows the Commission to review the company's disclosures.
 
5. Rule 701 promulgated under the Securities Act provides an exemption from registration for certain issuers offering and selling stock options (or other securities) to employees and consultants under compensatory benefit plans. However, Rule 701 requires (among other things) that any company issuing more than $5 million in stock options over a 12-month period provide detailed financial statements and other disclosures to the option recipients. The Rule allows privately-held companies to compensate their employees with securities without incurring the obligations of public registration and reporting, while ensuring that essential information is provided to employees.
 
 
6. Since its inception, Google has granted stock options to its employees and consultants as a form of compensation. Under Google's stock option plans, Google's Board of Directors granted the company's employees and consultants options to buy a certain number of Google unregistered shares at an exercise price set by Google's Board. Although the stock options were not registered, Google relied on Rule 701 of the Securities Act to exempt those securities from the registration requirements of the federal securities laws.
 
7. In September 2002, Google became aware that its continued issuance of stock option grants might reach levels requiring financial disclosures under Rule 701. Google temporarily stopped issuing stock grants. In contrast to its chief competitors, Google was a private company, and did not have to report its financial results and other significant business information to the public in filings with the Commission. Google viewed the public disclosure of its detailed financial information as strategically disadvantageous, as Drummond recognized, and the company was concerned that providing option recipients with the financial disclosures required by Rule 701 could result in the disclosure of this information to the public at large and, significantly, to Google's competitors.
 
8. By January 2003, Google was again considering granting stock options to its employees. Drummond learned that the stock option grants being considered for approval by Google's Board might cause Google to grant more than $5 million worth of options in a 12-month period and therefore would require Google to provide option recipients with financial disclosures under Rule 701. Drummond, in consultation with outside counsel and personnel in Google's legal department, determined that other exemptions for certain of the stock option grants permitted Google to issue the option grants without registering the securities or providing disclosures otherwise required by Rule 701. For example, Rule 506 of Regulation D of the Securities Act exempts from registration certain sales to "accredited investors" (including investors meeting a particular level of net worth or annual income). Drummond also considered the potential applicability of Section 4(2) of the Securities Act, an exemption from registration for certain private securities offerings. Finally, Drummond determined that, even if it were later determined that his analysis of the applicability of other registration exemptions was incorrect, Google could make an offer of rescission to the option holders.
 
9. Drummond concluded that a sufficient number of options had been issued to Google's employees and executives who were accredited investors under Rule 506 to avoid exceeding Rule 701's $5 million threshold, at least for the immediate future.
 
10. Drummond attended a January 2003 meeting of Google's Board of Directors and advised the Board to approve a new stock option plan for employee and consultant option grants going forward. Drummond also advised that the Board issue stock option grants pursuant to that new stock option plan, which grants were to become effective when the plan became effective in
 
February. Drummond did not report to the Board that issuing the new option grants might cause Google to exceed the $5 million disclosure threshold of Rule 701, and that Google would be relying on other exemptions from the registration requirements.
 
11. At the January 2003 meeting, Google's Board approved the new stock option plan and the option grants pursuant to that plan, and the additional options became effective on February 7, 2003. Contrary to Drummond's expectations, the option grants resulted in Google exceeding Rule 701's $5 million disclosure threshold. Even excluding option grants arguably exempt from registration under Rule 506, the dollar value of options granted by Google over the prior 12-month period exceeded $5 million. Google, however, failed to provide the financial disclosures and other information mandated by Rule 701. Absent compliance with Rule 701, the options issued during this 12-month period were not exempt from registration, and Google's securities issuance violated the registration provisions of Section 5.
 
12. Between February and May 2003, Google continued to issue additional stock options to its employees. By unanimous written consent, Google's Board approved additional stock option grants on February 28, 2003, March 31, 2003, April 24, 2003, and May 9, 2003. As a result of these option grants, the value of securities issued by Google during a 12-month period was approximately $11 million, far in excess of the $5 million disclosure threshold of Rule 701, yet Google did not provide the legally required disclosures to the option recipients. Throughout this period, Google failed to monitor its stock option grant levels, and failed to determine whether the company was in compliance with Rule 701.
 
13. In approximately June 2003, Drummond learned that Google probably had exceeded the $5 million disclosure threshold of Rule 701. Drummond further believed that there were not likely to be enough stock option recipients who qualified as accredited investors to render the securities exempt from registration, and thus the company could not avoid the disclosure obligations of Rule 701 by relying on Rule 506.
 
14. Drummond believed that Google's stock option grants might be exempt under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act, an exemption available for certain private placements of securities.
 
15. At a June 2003 meeting, Google's Board of Directors adopted two new stock option plans allowing for the issuance of additional options beginning in July 2003. Drummond discussed the need for the stock option plans, but he did not advise the Board that Google's option grants would exceed the $5 million disclosure threshold of Rule 701 or of the risk that other exemptions from registration may not apply. Based in part on Drummond's advice, Google issued additional options in the months following the Board approval exceeding the $5 million disclosure threshold.
 
16. Google's option grants did not qualify for exemption under Section 4(2). Among other things, Google offered millions of dollars worth of stock options to all of its employees without considering the financial sophistication of each employee, and did not provide its employees with the information found in a registration statement.
 
17. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, Google issued approximately $49 million worth of stock options. Pursuant to the stock option plans adopted in June 2003, Google issued an additional $33 million worth of options in the first four months of 2004, prior to the company's filing of a registration statement for its initial public offering. None of these option grants were accompanied by the disclosures required by Rule 701.
 
18. On August 4, 2004, Google filed a Form S-1 with the Commission to register a rescission offer for the stock option grants and the purchase of shares upon the exercise of options made between September 2001 and June 2004 to Google's employees and consultants. The Form S-1 was declared effective on November 24, 2004. However, the rescission offer does not cure a violation of Section 5.
 
D.
Legal Conclusion
 
19. Section 5(a) of the Securities Act prohibits the use of any means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or of the mails to sell a security unless a registration statement is in effect as to such security. Section 5(c) of the Securities Act prohibits the use of any means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce or of the mails to offer to sell or offer to buy a security unless a registration statement has been filed as to such security.
 
20. Google offered to sell and sold its securities without a registration statement filed or in effect and without a valid exemption from registration. As a result of the conduct described above, Google violated, and Drummond caused Google to violate, Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act. The Commission previously has charged attorneys for causing Section 5 violations. Securities Act Rel. No. 33-8189 (Feb. 3, 2003).

21. In determining to accept Google and Drummond's offer of settlement, the Commission took into account their cooperation during the Commission staff's investigation.

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act, that Respondents Google and Drummond cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act.

Google, a Silicon Valley search engine technology company, issued certain stock options to the company's employees and consultants during 2003 without registering the offering and without providing financial information required to be disclosed under state securities laws. As a result, Google employees and other persons accepted Google securities as part of their compensation without certain detailed financial information about the company. By issuing the options without registering the offering and without the legally required disclosures, Google violated the securities qualification provisions of California Corporations Code Sections 25110.
 
 
Google, Inc. is a Delaware corporation with its principal executive offices located in Mountain View, California. Founded in 1998, Google is an Internet search engine technology provider. On April 29, 2004, Google filed a registration statement for an initial public offering of securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which became effective on August 19, 2004.
 
Rule 701 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 provides an exemption from registration for certain issuers offering and selling stock options (or other securities) to employees and consultants under compensatory benefit plans. The terms of Rule 701 are incorporated by reference into Section 25102(o) of the California Corporations Code, which sets forth the terms of an exemption from the registration requirements of Section 25110.
 
However, Rule 701 requires (among other things) that any company issuing more than $5 million in stock options over a 12-month period provide detailed financial statements and other disclosures to the option recipients. The Rule allows privately-held companies to compensate their employees with securities without incurring the obligations of public registration and reporting, while ensuring that essential information is provided to employees.
 
Since its inception, Google has granted stock options to its employees and consultants as a form of compensation. Under Google's stock option plans, Google's Board of Directors granted the company's employees and consultants options to buy a certain number of Google unqualified shares at an exercise price set by Google's Board. Although the stock options were not qualified, Google relied on Rule 701 of the Securities Act to exempt those securities from the registration requirements of the federal securities laws (and the qualification requirements of the California securities laws as well. See California Corporations Code 25102(o).)
 
In September 2002, Google became aware that its continued issuance of stock option grants might reach levels requiring financial disclosures under Rule 701. Google temporarily stopped issuing stock grants. In contrast to its chief competitors, Google was a private company, and did not have to report its financial results and other significant business information to the public in filings with the Commission. Google viewed the public disclosure of its detailed financial information as
 
strategically disadvantageous, and the company was concerned that providing option recipients with the financial disclosures required by Rule 701 could result in the disclosure of this information to the public at large and, significantly, to Google's competitors.
 
At a January 2003 meeting, Google's Board approved a new stock option plan and the option grants pursuant to that plan, and the additional options became effective on February 7, 2003. The option grants resulted in Google exceeding Rule 701's $5 million disclosure threshold, thereby depriving it of any exemption from California Corporations Code Section 25110 provided by Section 25102(o). Even excluding option grants arguably exempt from qualification under other subsections, the dollar value of options granted by Google over the prior 12-month period exceeded $5 million. Google, however, failed to provide the financial disclosures and other information mandated by Rule 701. Absent compliance with Rule 701 (and California Corporations Code Section 25102(o)), the options issued during this 12-month period were not exempt from qualification with the California Department of Corporations, and Google's securities issuance violated the qualification provisions of California Corporations Code Section 25110.
 
Between February and May 2003, Google continued to issue additional stock options to its employees. By unanimous written consent, Google's Board approved additional stock option grants on February 28, 2003, March 31, 2003, April 24, 2003, and May 9, 2003. As a result of these option grants, the value of securities issued by Google during a 12-month period was approximately $11 million, substantially in excess of the $5 million disclosure threshold of Rule 701, yet Google did not provide the legally required disclosures to the option recipients. Throughout this period, Google failed to monitor its stock option grant levels, and failed to determine whether the company was in compliance with Rule 701. On June 19, 2003, Google filed an application with the Department of Corporations for qualification of the subject securities (options), which application was approved.
 
Based upon the foregoing findings, the California Corporations Commissioner is of the opinion that Google offered or sold securities without being qualified in violation of Corporations Code section 25110 between February and May 2003. Google neither admits nor denies the foregoing findings.
 
Pursuant to section 25532 of the Corporate Securities Law of 1968, Google is hereby ordered, and Google agrees, to desist and refrain from the further offer or sale in the State of California of securities, unless and until qualification has been made under the law, or unless Google is otherwise exempt. This Order is necessary, in the public interest, for the protection of investors and consistent with the purposes, policies, and provisions of the Corporate Securities Law of 1968.
 
In consideration of this Consent Order, Google, Inc. waives its right to a hearing on this matter and to judicial review of this matter pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.5. This Consent Order is a public document and will be posted on the web site of the Department of Corporations.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
On February 1, 2005, Google is issuing a press release and holding a conference call regarding its financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and the year ended December 31, 2004. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
 
This information shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
Google is making reference to non-GAAP financial information in both the press release and the conference call. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures is contained in the attached press release.
 
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  February 1, 2005  Google Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG) today announced financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2004.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Google had an exceptional quarter. Revenues and profits increased significantly, our execution was solid across the company and most importantly, our relationship with our users, partners and advertisers became even stronger," said Eric Schmidt, Google chief executive officer. "All of this happened while we continued to innovate, expand around the world and make strategic, long-term investments."
 
Q4 Financial Highlights
 
Revenues in the quarter totaled a record $1.032 billion, representing a 28% increase over the third quarter of 2004 and a 101% year-over-year increase. This revenues growth reflects strong traffic and monetization growth in the quarter as well as advertisers' growing recognition of the Internet as an effective advertising medium.
Revenues -
 
Google-owned sites generated $530 million or 51% of total revenues. This represents an increase of 118% over the fourth quarter of 2003.
Google-Sites Revenues
-
 
Revenues generated on Google's partner sites, through AdSense programs, contributed $490 million, or 48% of total revenues, a 92% increase over the Network revenues generated in the same quarter last year.
The Google Network
-
 
, the portion of revenues shared with Google's partners, increased to $378 million or 77% of Google Network revenues. This compares to total payments to partners of $216 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, or 85% of Google Network revenues.
TAC  Traffic Acquisition Costs
 
Income from operations in the quarter, on a GAAP basis, totaled $303 million or 29.4% of revenues, and included a non-cash charge of $60 million for stock-based compensation. This compares to operating income of $86 million or 16.9% of revenues in the same period of 2003, when the stock-based compensation charge was $85 million. This improvement in operating margins was primarily due to decreases in stock-based compensation expense and traffic acquisition cost as a percentage of revenues.
Income from Operations 
 
- Google recorded a provision for income taxes of $106 million in the fourth quarter, an effective tax rate of 34% as compared to a $62 million provision for income taxes and a 70 % effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2003. The provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter was reduced by $66 million related to certain items, $42 million due to ISO disqualifying dispositions and $24 million related to certain stock-based compensation charges recognized prior to the IPO. The company expects its effective tax rate before these items to generally trend lower over the long term to a rate below 35%. However, the company may experience volatility in its quarterly effective tax rates as a result of certain stock option activity.
Income Taxes
 
- Net income on a GAAP basis increased to $204 million or 19.8% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2004 as compared to $27 million or 5.3% of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2003. Earnings on a diluted per share basis were $0.71 in the fourth quarter of 2004 as compared to $0.10 in the fourth quarter of 2003.
Net Income
Fiscal Year 2004 Financial Highlights
 
- Google reported revenues for calendar year 2004 of $3.189 billion, a 118% increase over the $1.466 billion reported for 2003. Google saw growth throughout the year both in our domestic business and internationally, both on Google owned sites and on the Google Network.
Revenues
 
Specifically, revenues from Google owned sites increased 101% on a year over year basis, from $792 million to $1.6 billion. The company attributes the rapid growth to increased visits to its sites and to its accumulated knowledge of how to more effectively and efficiently monetize that traffic. Revenues from the Google Network grew 147% in the year, from $629 million in 2003 to $1.6 billion in 2004. This growth reflects growth in the number of partners in the network in both the AdSense for Search and the AdSense for Content programs, as well as improved monetization of those programs.
 
 On a GAAP basis (including the settlement charge) our operating income in 2004 rose 87% on a year-over-year basis to $640 million, representing a full year operating margin of 20.1%. Excluding the effect of a third-quarter, 2004 non-cash, non-recurring charge associated with a legal settlement, our operating income for the full year 2004 increased 146% to $841 million, up from $342 million the prior year. Again, excluding the aforementioned charge, our operating margin for the full year rose to 26.4% from 23.4% the previous year. Operating income as reported in both 2004 and 2003 was reduced by significant non-cash stock-based compensation charges of $279 million and $229 million respectively.
Income
from Operations
 
 Net income for the year 2004 rose to $399 million from $106 million in 2003, an increase of 278%. Adjusting for the impact of the third quarter 2004 settlement charge and for certain tax benefits, net income totaled $406 million in 2004. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share increased to $1.46 this year from $0.41 in 2003.
Net Income
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased 147% to $977 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 from $395 million in 2003. Free cash flow is an alternative measure of liquidity to GAAP net cash provided by operating activities and is calculated as operating cash flows less capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were $319 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 as compared to $177 million in the twelve months ended 2003. Free cash flow for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 totaled $658 million as compared to $219 million for the same period in 2003, an increase of 200%.
Cash Flow
 
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before the non-cash stock-based compensation charge, the non-cash and non-recurring settlement charge and in-process R&D. It is another alternative measure of liquidity to GAAP net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA increased to approximately $1.280 billion in 2004, or 40% of revenues, from $638 million, or 44% of revenues, in 2003. For the fourth quarter of 2004, adjusted EBITDA increased to $425 million from $321 million in the third quarter. The reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to the GAAP measure of liquidity, net cash provided by operating activities, is set forth at the back of this release.
Adjusted EBITDA 
 As of December 31, 2004, Google had a cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance of $2.132 billion.
Cash
 
On a worldwide basis, Google employed 3,021 full time employees as of December 31, 2004, up from 2,668 as of September 30, 2004.

Forward looking statements
 
This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements relating to the Google's market opportunity and future business prospects. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are included in Google's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and from time to time in other reports filed by Google with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
About non-GAAP financial measures.
 
To supplement Google's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, Google uses non-GAAP measures of certain financial performance and liquidity. These non-GAAP measures are comprised of income from operations, net income and net income per share before material non-recurring and other items, as well as free cash flows and adjusted EBITDA. Google's management believes that income from operations before material non-recurring and other items and net income before material non-recurring and other items provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the company's core operating results because they exclude amounts that are not necessarily related to those core results and are of a substantially non-recurring nature. Google's management believes that free cash flows and adjusted EBITDA provide meaningful supplemental information regarding liquidity. Google believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of Google's ongoing operations and liquidity and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Google's historical operating results and liquidity.
 
Google computes its non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. The accompanying tables have more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.

Senior Executive Bonus Plan
 
On February 15, 2005, the Board of Directors of Google Inc. (the "Company") approved a Senior Executive Bonus Plan for 2005 (the "Plan"), which is a variable cash incentive program designed to motivate participants to achieve the Company's financial and other performance objectives, and to reward them for their achievements when those objectives are met. All of the Company's executive officers (excluding the Company's Chief Executive Officer and its Presidents) are eligible to be considered for participation in the Plan solely at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Target bonuses vary based on the executive's salary, and the amount of target bonus actually paid to individual employees will be based on the achievement of (i) certain individual performance objectives tailored to each executive's role in the Company and (ii) certain Company performance objectives tied to the Company's annual revenue and operating profit; provided that other financial goals may be assessed as determined appropriate by the Company's Board of Directors.
 
This brief description of the Plan is qualified by reference to the 2005 Senior Executive Bonus Plan attached as Exhibit 10.16 to this report.
 
 
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

Exhibit 10.16
 
 
Summary
 
Google's Senior Executive Bonus Plan (the "Plan") is a variable cash incentive program designed to motivate participants to achieve the company's financial and other performance objectives and to reward them for their achievements when those objectives are met.
 
Eligibility
 
Participants are approved solely at the discretion of the Board of Directors. All executive officers except for our CEO and Presidents are eligible to be considered for participation in 2005. No person is automatically entitled to participate in the Plan in any year, and any eligible participant may choose not to participate in the Plan in any year for any reason.
 
Administration
 
The Board of Directors or a committee appointed by the Board of Directors (the "Administrator") is ultimately responsible for administering the Plan. The Administrator has all powers and discretion necessary or appropriate to review and approve the Plan and its operation, including, but not limited to, the power to (a) determine which eligible participants shall be granted bonus awards, (b) prescribe the terms and conditions of bonus awards, (c) interpret the Plan, (d) adopt rules for the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan as are consistent therewith, and (e) interpret, amend or revoke any such rules. All determinations and decisions made by the Administrator and any delegate of the Administrator shall be final, conclusive, and binding on all persons, and shall be given the maximum deference permitted by law. The Administrator, in its sole discretion and on such terms and conditions as it may provide, may delegate all or part of its authority and powers under the Plan to one or more directors, officers and/or managers of the Company. The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may amend or terminate the Plan, or any part thereof, at any time and for any reason.
 
Award Determination
 
The Administrator, in its sole discretion, will approve target bonuses for each participant. Bonuses will be calculated using a formula that includes: (a) the executive's salary, (b) the executive's target bonus, (c) an "Individual Multiplier," and (d) a "Company Multiplier." Multipliers become higher with higher levels of achievement and are determined as follows:
 
The Individual Multiplier
 
For each participant in the Plan, the Administrator approves an Individual Multiplier that reflects the participant's contributions relative to individual performance expectations for the performance period. Individual performance expectations vary to reflect each executive's role in the company. An "on target" assessment yields a 100% multiplier.
 
The Company Multiplier
 
The Administrator approves a Company Multiplier for all participants by assessing Company financial performance against pre-established annual goals for revenue and operating profit; provided that other financial goals may be assessed as determined appropriate by the Board of Directors. An "on target" assessment yields a 100% multiplier.
 
Award Payouts
 
Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, bonuses will be paid on an annual basis, typically in February, and the bonus period is currently the fiscal year period. Actual bonuses payable for 2005, if any, will vary to reflect the amount by which each target is exceeded or missed and are not currently determinable. The maximum bonus that any participant may receive under the Plan in 2005 is $3 million.

Exhibit 99.1
 
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  April 21, 2005  Google Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG) today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2005.
 
"This was a very strong quarter for Google. We continue to execute well and we have been able to take full advantage of the growth in online advertising" said Eric Schmidt, Google chief executive officer. "In addition, we performed well across our operations with our engineering and product teams delivering dozens of new products and features for Google users around the world."
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Financial Highlights
 
Revenues in the quarter totaled a record $1.256 billion, representing a 22% increase over the fourth quarter of 2004 and a 93% year-over-year increase. This revenue increase reflects strong traffic and monetization growth in the quarter as well as advertisers' growing recognition of the Internet as an effective advertising medium.
Revenues -
 
Google-owned sites generated $657 million or 52% of total revenues. This represents an increase of 116% over the first quarter of 2004.
Google-Sites Revenues
-
 
Revenues generated on Google's partner sites, through AdSense programs, contributed $584 million, or 47% of total revenues, a 75% increase over the Network revenues generated in the same quarter last year.
The Google Network
-
 
, the portion of revenues shared with Google's partners, increased to $462 million. This compares to total payments to partners of $271 million in the first quarter of 2004.
TAC  Traffic Acquisition Costs
 
Income from operations in the first quarter, on a GAAP basis, was $443 million or 35.2% of revenues, and included a non-cash charge of $49 million for stock-based compensation. This compares to income from operations of $155 million or 23.8% of revenues in the first quarter of 2004, when the stock-based compensation charge was $76 million. This improvement in operating margins was primarily due to decreases in both stock-based compensation expense and TAC as a percentage of revenues.
Income from Operations 
 
- Google recorded a provision for income taxes of $87 million in the first quarter of 2005, an effective tax rate of 19% as compared to a $92 million provision for income taxes and a 59% effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2004. The provision for income taxes in this year's first quarter was reduced by $49 million related to ISO disqualifying dispositions. The effective tax rate for the remainder of 2005 is expected to be less than 30%. However if future revenues recognized by Google's Irish subsidiary are not as proportionately great as expected, Google's effective tax rate will be higher than expected.
Income Taxes
- Net income on a GAAP basis increased to $369 million or 29.4% of revenues in the first quarter of 2005 as compared to $64 million or 9.8% of revenues in the first quarter of 2004. Earnings on a diluted per share basis were $1.29 in the first quarter of 2005 as compared to $0.24 in the first quarter of 2004.
Net Income
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased 155% to $530 million for the three months ended March 31, 2005 from $208 million in the three months ended March 31, 2004. Free cash flow is an alternative non-GAAP measure of liquidity to GAAP net cash provided by operating activities and is calculated as operating cash flows less capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were $142 million in the three months ended March 31, 2005 as compared to $86 million in the three months ended March 31, 2004. Free cash flow for the three months ended March 31, 2005 totaled approximately $387 million as compared to $122 million for the same period in 2004, an increase of 217%.
Cash Flow
 
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, the non-cash stock-based compensation charge and in-process R&D. It is another alternative measure of liquidity to GAAP net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA increased to approximately $548 million in Q1 2005 (or 44% of revenues) from $255 million (or 39% of revenues) in Q1 2004.
Adjusted EBITDA 
 
The reconciliations of free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities, the GAAP measure of liquidity, is set forth at the back of this release.
 
 As of March 31, 2005, Google had a cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $2.507 billion.
Cash
 
On a worldwide basis, Google employed 3,482 full time employees as of March 31, 2005, up from 3,021 as of December 31, 2004.

About non-GAAP financial measures.
 
To supplement Google's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, Google uses the following measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the SEC: free cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, net income before certain income tax items and net income per share before certain income tax items. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Results of Operations Measures to the Nearest Comparable GAAP Measures," and "Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Liquidity Measures to the Nearest Comparable GAAP Measures" set forth at the back of this release.
 
Google's management believes that net income and adjusted net income per share, before certain income tax items, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the company's core results because they exclude amounts that are not necessarily related to those core results and are of a substantially non-recurring nature. Google's management believes that free cash flows and adjusted EBITDA provide meaningful supplemental information regarding liquidity. Google believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of Google's ongoing operations and liquidity and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Google's historical operating results and liquidity.
 
Google computes its non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. The accompanying tables have more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.

For purposes of this Section 6(a), Incentive Stock Options will be taken into account in the order in which they were granted. The Fair Market Value of the Shares will be determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted.
ISO $100,000 Rule
 
(b) . Neither the Plan nor any Award shall confer upon a Participant any right with respect to continuing his or her relationship as a Service Provider, nor shall they interfere in any way with the right of the Participant or the right of the Company or its Parent or Subsidiaries to terminate such relationship at any time, with or without cause.
No Rights as a Service Provider

Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Units and Performance Shares Annual Limit
 
(iii) . For purposes of qualifying grants of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares or Performance Units as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator, in its discretion, may set restrictions based upon the achievement of Performance Goals. The Performance Goals shall be set by the Administrator on or before the latest date permissible to enable the Restricted Stock Units, Restricted Stock, Performance Shares or Performance Units to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code. In granting Restricted Stock Units, Restricted Stock, Performance Shares or Performance Units which are intended to qualify under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator shall follow any procedures determined by it from time to time to be necessary or appropriate to ensure qualification of the Award under Section 162(m) of the Code (e.g., in determining the Performance Goals).

(iv) The foregoing limitations will be adjusted proportionately in connection with any change in the Company's capitalization as described in Section 15 of the Plan.
 
(v) If an Award is cancelled in the same Fiscal Year in which it was granted (other than in connection with a transaction described in Section 15 of the Plan), the cancelled Award will be counted against the limits set forth in subsections (i) and (ii) above.

In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the per Share exercise price will be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
 
(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Incentive Stock Options may be granted with a per Share exercise price of less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant pursuant to a merger or other corporate transaction.
 
(ii) . At the time an Option is granted, the Administrator will fix the period within which the Option may be exercised and will determine any conditions that must be satisfied before the Option may be exercised.
Waiting Period and Exercise Dates
 
(c) . The Administrator will determine the acceptable form of consideration for exercising an Option, including the method of payment. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the Administrator will determine the acceptable form of consideration at the time of grant. Such consideration to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws may consist entirely of:
Form of Consideration
 
(i) cash;
 
(ii) check;
 
(iii) promissory note;
 
(iv) other Shares which meet the conditions established by the Administrator to avoid adverse accounting consequences (as determined by the Administrator);
 
(v) consideration received by the Company under a cashless exercise program implemented by the Company in connection with the Plan;
 
(vi) a reduction in the amount of any Company liability to the Participant, including any liability attributable to the Participant's participation in any Company-sponsored deferred compensation program or arrangement;
 
(vii) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment; or
 
(viii) such other consideration and method of payment for the issuance of Shares to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.
 
(d) .
Exercise of Option
 
(i) . Any Option granted hereunder will be exercisable according to the terms of the Plan and at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Administrator and set forth in the Award Agreement. An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.
Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Stockholder
 
An Option will be deemed exercised when the Company receives: (x) written or electronic notice of exercise (in accordance with the Award Agreement) from the person entitled to exercise the Option, and (y) full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised. Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Award Agreement and the Plan. Shares issued upon exercise of an Option will be issued in the name of the Participant or, if requested by the Participant, in the name of the Participant and his or her spouse. Until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder will exist with respect to the Awarded Stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company will issue (or cause to be issued) such Shares promptly after the Option is exercised. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the Shares are issued, except as provided in Section 15 of the Plan or the applicable Award Agreement.
 
Exercising an Option in any manner will decrease the number of Shares thereafter available for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.
 
(ii) . If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider, other than upon the Participant's death or Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for three (3) months following the Participant's termination. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if on the date of termination the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will revert to the Plan on the date one (1) month following the Participant's termination. If after termination the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified by the Administrator, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.
Termination of Relationship as a Service Provider
 
(iii) . If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider as a result of the Participant's Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following the Participant's termination. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if on the date of termination the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will revert to the Plan on the date one (1) month following the Participant's termination. If after termination the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.
Disability of Participant
 
(iv) . If a Participant dies while a Service Provider, the Option may be exercised following the Participant's death within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of death (but in no event may the option be exercised later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement), by the Participant's designated beneficiary, provided such beneficiary has been designated prior to Participant's death in a form acceptable to the Administrator. If no such beneficiary has been designated by the Participant, then such Option may be exercised by the personal representative of the Participant's estate or by the person(s) to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to the Participant's will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution. In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following Participant's death. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if at the time of death Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will immediately revert to the Plan on the date one (1) month following the Participant's death. If the Option is not so exercised within the time specified herein, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.
Death of Participant
 
(e) . The Administrator may at any time offer to buy out for a payment in cash or Shares an Option previously granted based on such terms and conditions as the Administrator shall establish and communicate to the Participant at the time that such offer is made.

(a) . Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, Performance Units and Performance Shares may be granted to Service Providers at any time and from time to time, as will be determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion.

Value of Performance Units/Shares
 
(c) . The Administrator will set performance objectives in its discretion which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the number or value of Performance Units/Shares that will be paid out to the Service Providers. The time period during which the performance objectives must be met will be called the "Performance Period." Each Award of Performance Units/Shares will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the Performance Period, and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine. The Administrator may set performance objectives based upon the achievement of Company-wide, divisional, or individual goals, applicable federal or state securities laws, or any other basis determined by the Administrator in its discretion.

(d) . After the applicable Performance Period has ended, the holder of Performance Units/Shares will be entitled to receive a payout of the number of Performance Units/Shares earned by the Participant over the Performance Period, to be determined as a function of the extent to which the corresponding performance objectives have been achieved. After the grant of a Performance Unit/Share, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any performance objectives for such Performance Unit/Share.

A Service Provider will not cease to be an Employee in the case of (i) any leave of absence approved by the Company or (ii) transfers between locations of the Company or between the Company, its Parent, or any Subsidiary. For purposes of Incentive Stock Options, no such leave may exceed ninety (90) days, unless reemployment upon expiration of such leave is guaranteed by statute or contract.

Notwithstanding the preceding, the number of Shares subject to any Award always shall be a whole number.
Adjustments
 
(b) . In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator will notify each Participant as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction. The Administrator in its discretion may provide for a Participant to have the right to exercise his or her Award, to the extent applicable, until ten (10) days prior to such transaction as to all of the Awarded Stock covered thereby, including Shares as to which the Award would not otherwise be exercisable.

Dissolution or Liquidation
 
(c) .
Merger or Change in Control
 
(i) . In the event of a merger or Change in Control, each outstanding Option and SAR shall be assumed or an equivalent option or SAR substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. With respect to Options and SARs granted to an Outside Director that are assumed or substituted for, if immediately prior to or after the merger or Change in Control the Participant's status as a Director or a director of the successor corporation, as applicable, is terminated other than upon a voluntary resignation by the Participant, then the Participant shall fully vest in and have the right to exercise such Options and SARs as to all of the Awarded Stock, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested or exercisable. Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, in the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Option or SAR, the Participant shall fully vest in and have the right to exercise the Option or SAR as to all of the Awarded Stock, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested or exercisable. If an Option or SAR is not assumed or substituted in the event of a merger or Change in Control, the Administrator shall notify the Participant in writing or electronically that the
Stock Options and SARS
 
Option or SAR shall be exercisable, to the extent vested, for a period of up to fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, and the Option or SAR shall terminate upon the expiration of such period. For the purposes of this paragraph, the Option or SAR shall be considered assumed if, following the merger or Change in Control, the option or stock appreciation right confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share of Awarded Stock subject to the Option or SAR immediately prior to the merger or Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the merger or Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the merger or Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of the Option or SAR, for each Share of Awarded Stock subject to the Option or SAR, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or Change in Control. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more performance goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such performance goals without the Participant's consent; provided, however, a modification to such performance goals only to reflect the successor corporation's post-merger or post-Change in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.
 
(ii) . In the event of a merger or Change in Control, each outstanding Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award and Restricted Stock Unit awards shall be assumed or an equivalent Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award and Restricted Stock Unit award substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. With respect to Awards granted to an Outside Director that are assumed or substituted for, if immediately prior to or after the merger or Change in Control the Participant's status as a Director or a director of the successor corporation, as applicable, is terminated other than upon a voluntary resignation by the Participant, then the Participant shall fully vest in such Awards, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested. Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, in the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award or Restricted Stock Unit award, the Participant shall fully vest in the Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award or Restricted Stock Unit including as to Shares which would not otherwise be vested. For the purposes of this paragraph, a Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award and Restricted Stock Unit award shall be considered assumed if, following the merger or Change in Control, the award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Award immediately prior to the merger or Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the merger or Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the merger or Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received, for each Share and each unit/right to acquire a Share subject to the Award, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or Change in Control. Notwithstanding
Restricted Stock, Performance Shares, Performance Units, Restricted Stock Units and Other Stock Based Awards
 
anything herein to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more performance goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such performance goals without the Participant's consent; provided, however, a modification to such performance goals only to reflect the successor corporation's post-merger or post-Change in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.
 
16. . The date of grant of an Award will be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the determination granting such Award, or such other later date as is determined by the Administrator. Notice of the determination will be provided to each Participant within a reasonable time after the date of such grant.
Date of Grant
 
17. . Subject to Section 22 of the Plan, the Plan will become effective upon its adoption by the Board. It will continue in effect for a term of ten (10) years unless terminated earlier under Section 18 of the Plan.
Term of Plan
 
18. .
Amendment and Termination of the Plan
 
(a) . The Board may at any time amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan.
Amendment and Termination
 
(b) . The Company will obtain stockholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with Applicable Laws.
Stockholder Approval
 
(c) . Subject to Section 20 of the Plan, no amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan will impair the rights of any Participant, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Participant and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Participant and the Company. Termination of the Plan will not affect the Administrator's ability to exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to Awards granted under the Plan prior to the date of such termination.
Effect of Amendment or Termination
 
19. .
Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares
 
(a) . Shares will not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Award unless the exercise of such Award and the issuance and delivery of such Shares will comply with Applicable Laws and will be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
Legal Compliance
 
(b) . As a condition to the exercise or receipt of an Award, the Company may require the person exercising or receiving such Award to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise or receipt that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required.
Investment Representations
 
20. . Notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Plan or an Award to the contrary, if any one or more of the provisions (or any part thereof) of this Plan or the Awards shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such provision shall be modified so as to make it valid, legal and enforceable, and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions (or any part thereof) of the Plan or Award, as applicable, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
Severability
 
21. . The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, will relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority will not have been obtained.
Inability to Obtain Authority
 
22. . The Plan will be subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date the Plan is adopted. Such stockholder approval will be obtained in the manner and to the degree required under Applicable Laws.
Stockholder Approval

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
On July 21, 2005, Google is issuing a press release and holding a conference call regarding its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 ended June 30, 2005. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
 
This information shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
 
Google is making reference to non-GAAP financial information in both the press release and the conference call. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures is contained in the attached press release.
 
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  July 21, 2005  Google Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG) today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2005.
 
"We had an excellent quarter. We continued to innovate, we continued to execute and we stayed focused on our users," said Eric Schmidt, Google chief executive officer. "Google had another solid performance."
 
Google reported record revenues of $1.384 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, up 98% year over year. Google reports its revenues, consistent with GAAP, on a gross basis without deducting traffic acquisition costs or TAC, the portion of revenues shared with partners.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Financial Highlights
 
Revenues in the second quarter totaled a record $1.384 billion, representing a 10% increase over the first quarter of 2005 and a 98% year-over-year increase. This revenue increase reflects strong traffic and monetization growth in the quarter as well as advertisers' growing recognition of the Internet as an effective advertising medium.
Revenues 
 
Google-owned sites generated $737 million or 53% of total revenues. This represents an increase of 115% over the second quarter of 2004.
Google-Sites Revenues
-
 
Revenues generated on Google's partner sites, through AdSense programs, contributed $630 million, or 46% of total revenues, an 82% increase over the Network revenues generated in the same quarter last year.
The Google Network
-
 
, the portion of revenues shared with Google's partners, increased to $494 million. This compares to total payments to partners of $277 million in the second quarter of 2004.
TAC  Traffic Acquisition Costs
 
Income from operations in the second quarter, on a GAAP basis, was $476 million or 34.4% of revenues, and included a non-cash charge of $47 million for stock-based compensation. This compares to income from operations of $171 million or 24.4% of revenues in the second quarter of 2004, when the stock-based compensation charge was $75 million. This improvement in operating margins was primarily because of decreases in TAC, Sales and Marketing expense and stock-based compensation expense as a percentage of revenues, offset by increases in R&D, other cost of revenues and G&A expense.
Income from Operations 
 
 Google recorded a provision for income taxes of $153 million in the second quarter of 2005, an effective tax rate of 31% as compared to a $90 million provision for income taxes and a 53% effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2004. We continue to expect that the effective tax rate for 2005 will be less than 30%. However if future revenues recognized by Google's Irish subsidiary are not as proportionately significant as expected, Google's effective tax rate will be higher than expected.
Income Taxes
 Net income on a GAAP basis increased to $343 million or 24.8% of revenues in the second quarter of 2005 as compared to $79 million or 11.3% of revenues in the second quarter of 2004. Earnings on a per share diluted basis were $1.19 in the second quarter of 2005 as compared to $0.30 in the second quarter of 2004.
Net Income
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased 283% to $625 million for the three months ended June 30, 2005 from $163 million for the three months ended June 30, 2004. Free cash flow is an alternative non-GAAP measure of liquidity to GAAP net cash provided by operating activities and is calculated as operating cash flows less capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were approximately $158 million in the three months ended June 30, 2005 as compared to $96 million in the three months ended June 30, 2004. Free cash flow for the three months ended June 30, 2005 totaled $467 million as compared to $67 million for the same period in 2004, an increase of approximately 600%.
Cash Flow
 
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, the non-cash stock-based compensation charge and in-process R&D. It is another alternative measure of liquidity to GAAP net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA increased to approximately $590 million in the second quarter of 2005 (or 43% of revenues) from $278 million (or 40% of revenues) in the second quarter of 2004.
Adjusted EBITDA 
 
The reconciliations of free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities, the GAAP measure of liquidity, is set forth at the back of this release.
 
 As of June 30, 2005, Google had a cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $2.9 billion.
Cash

About non-GAAP financial measures.
 
To supplement Google's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, Google uses the following measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the SEC: free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Liquidity Measures to the Nearest Comparable GAAP Measures" set forth at the back of this release.
 
Google's management believes that free cash flows and adjusted EBITDA provide meaningful supplemental information regarding liquidity. Google believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of Google's liquidity and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Google's historical liquidity.
 
Google computes its non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. The accompanying tables have more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.

On October 20, 2005, Google is issuing a press release and holding a conference call regarding its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 ended September 30, 2005. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. - October 20, 2005 - Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2005.
 
"Although this is typically a slower season for Internet properties, we had another exceptional quarter," said Eric Schmidt, Google chief executive officer. "Our focus on end users and on quality of information and advertising worldwide continues to work extremely well. We are very pleased with how well this is working at scale."
 
Financial Summary
 
Google reported record revenues of $1.578 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, up 96% compared to the third quarter of 2004, and up 14% compared to last quarter. Google reports its revenues, consistent with GAAP, on a gross basis without deducting traffic acquisition costs, or TAC. This quarter, TAC totaled $530 million, or 34% percent of advertising revenues.
 
We have reported operating income, net income and earnings per share (EPS) on a GAAP basis and have also provided related non-GAAP, or pro forma, results on a supplemental basis below. Please also refer to the section below titled "About non-GAAP financial measures."
 
 
 
 
 
Financial Highlights
 
Revenues in the third quarter totaled a record $1.578 billion, representing a 96% increase over third quarter 2004 revenues of $806 million, and a 14% increase over second quarter 2005 revenues of $1.384 billion. Growth since last quarter was driven by the continued expansion of our global advertiser base and partner network, as well as by product improvements, and more than offset the expected seasonal slowdown in traffic.
Revenues -
 
- Google-owned sites generated $885 million, or 56% of total revenues. This represents a 20% increase over the second quarter revenues of $737 million.
Google Sites Revenues
 
- Revenues generated on Google's partner sites, through AdSense programs, contributed $675 million, or 43% of total revenues. This is a 7% increase over network revenues of $630 million generated in the second quarter.
Google Network Revenues
 
- Revenues from outside of the United States contributed 39% of total revenue, compared to 39% in the second quarter and 35% in the third quarter of 2004.
International Revenues
 
, the portion of revenues shared with Google's partners, increased to $530 million. This compares to total payments to partners of $494 million in the second quarter. TAC as a percentage of advertising revenues decreased to 34.0% in the third quarter from 36.1% in the second quarter, reflecting the continued shift in our revenue mix from Google network revenue to Google site revenue.
TAC - Traffic Acquisition Costs
 
GAAP operating income in the third quarter was $529 million, or 33.5% of revenues. This compares to GAAP operating income of $476 million, or 34.4% of revenues, in the second quarter. Non-GAAP operating income in the third quarter was $596 million, or 37.8% of revenues. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $523 million, also 37.8% of revenues, in the second quarter. Increases in research and development (R&D) and general and administrative (G&A) spending as a percentage of revenues were balanced by growth in higher margin Google site revenue, resulting in steady margins quarter over quarter.
Operating Margins -
 
- Our effective tax rate remained steady at 31% this quarter and continues to reflect the mix of business generated in the U.S. and business generated through our Irish subsidiary. Our provision for income taxes was not materially affected by stock option activity, although we did realize a $105 million reduction to our income taxes payable as a result of this activity. We expect that the effective tax rate for the full year of 2005 will be approximately 30%. However, if future revenues recognized by Google's Irish subsidiary are not as proportionately great as expected, Google's effective tax rate will be higher than our expectations.
Income Taxes
 
- Net cash provided by operating activities for the third quarter totaled $647 million as compared to $625 million for the second quarter. Free cash flow, an alternative non-GAAP measure of liquidity, is defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. This quarter we generated $354 million in free cash flow. Our capital expenditures in the quarter were $293 million as compared to $157 million last quarter, and primarily reflect acquisitions of
Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures
additional land and office space to support our headquarters in Mountain View, California, and purchases of production servers and networking equipment. We are now estimating over $800 million in capital expenditures for 2005.
 
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, SBC, and IPR&D. It is another alternative non-GAAP measure of liquidity to GAAP net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA increased to approximately $672 million in the third quarter, or 43% of revenues, from $590 million, or 43% of revenues, in the second quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA -
 
Reconciliations of free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities, the GAAP measure of liquidity, are included at the end of this release.
 
- As of September 30, 2005, Google had a cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of just over $7.6 billion, of which $4.3 billion was raised during a follow-on equity offering that was completed this quarter.
Cash
 
On a worldwide basis, Google employed 4,989 full time employees as of September 30, 2005, up from 4,183 as of June 30, 2005.
 
Webcast and conference call information
 
A live audio webcast of Google's third-quarter earnings release call will be available at http://investor.google.com/news.html. The call begins today at 1:30 PM (PT) / 4:30 PM (ET). This press release, the financial tables, as well as other supplemental information including the reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures to their nearest comparable GAAP measures, are also available at that site. A replay of the call will be available beginning at 7:30 PM (ET) through midnight Thursday, November 3, by calling 888- 203-1112 in the United States or 719- 457-0820 for calls from outside the United States. The required confirmation code for the replay is 7995844.
 
Forward looking statements
 
This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements relating to our anticipated effective tax rate and our expected capital expenditures for 2005. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, risks related to our international operations, the mix of our US revenue as compared to our non-US revenue, the fact that we may have exposure to greater than expected tax liabilities, and our need to expend capital to accommodate the growth of our business, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions "Factors That Could Affect Future Results" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in our report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, which is on file with the SEC and is available on our investor relations website at investor.google.com and on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, which will be filed with the SEC in November 2005. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of October 20, 2005 and Google undertakes no duty to update this information.
About non-GAAP financial measures
 
To supplement Google's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, Google uses the following measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the SEC: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, free cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, and non-GAAP R&D expenses. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures," "Reconciliations of non-GAAP liquidity measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures," and "Reconciliation of non-GAAP research and development expenses to GAAP research and development expenses" included at the end of this release.
 
Google's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our core business operating results. Google believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing Google's performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Google's historical performance and liquidity and our competitors' operating results. We include these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making.
 
Google has computed its non-GAAP liquidity measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. Google expects to use consistent methods for computation of other non-GAAP financial measures introduced this quarter, including non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, and non-GAAP R&D expenses. The accompanying tables have more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On December 20, 2005, we entered into a letter agreement (the "") with Time Warner Inc. ("") and America Online, Inc. ("", and together with Google and Time Warner, the ""), pursuant to which the Parties agreed to consummate the transactions described in the Agreement. The Parties also agreed to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements, which are expected to be signed in the first calendar quarter of 2006, related to such transactions. The Parties have also agreed upon a binding expedited arbitration procedure, which should be completed during the first quarter of 2006, to resolve any disagreements between the Parties that would otherwise prevent the entering into of definitive agreements during the first quarter of 2006. The Agreement provides that, in the event the Parties do not enter into definitive agreements to consummate certain of the transactions described in the Agreement by February 18, 2006, the commercial transactions will take effect pursuant to the terms described in the Agreement.

Commercial Transactions
 
The other transactions described in the Agreement are of a commercial nature, and the terms of the agreements and amendments are five years from the date of the Agreement.
 
. We and AOL have agreed to extend the term of our current multi-country web search services agreement and our current U.S. text-based advertising services agreement.

AOL has agreed that we will be its exclusive provider of the services provided under these agreements, subject to certain limitations. Although the U.S. text-based advertising services agreement is now subject to certain revenue guarantees from us to AOL that apply given certain conditions, we do not expect the net economics under these agreements to be materially different compared to that which would have otherwise resulted under the existing agreements.
Web Search Services and Sponsored Links
 
. In addition to the text-based advertising sold by us that is distributed through our sponsored links syndication network (including AOL), we have agreed to enable AOL to sell text-based advertising for distribution on the AOL properties. Our revenue share from such advertising sold by AOL for AOL properties is roughly equivalent to the revenue share retained by us under the text-based advertising agreement for AOL properties.
AOL Marketplace
 
. We have agreed to grant AOL certain information rights related to our network of display advertising space and the right to sell display advertising into that network.
Display Advertising

Promotion

Content Availability
 
. We and AOL have agreed to develop the ability for users of AOL's Instant Messenger service and Google Talk to interact with both services from both the AOL Instant Messenger client and the Google Talk client, which will require a user to register a Google Talk user name with the AOL Instant Messenger Service in order to access it.

Safe Harbor Statement
 
This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including the statement that we do not expect the net economics of our text-based advertising services agreement with AOL to be materially different from our existing agreements with AOL. Actual results may differ materially from
our expected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations include fluctuations in Internet usage and click-through rates on such sponsored links that could adversely affect the economics under the text-based advertising services agreement. More information about potential risk factors that could affect the success of our business and the Agreement with AOL is included in our report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, and from time to time in other reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Time Warner's AOL and Google to Expand Strategic Alliance
 
Creating Global Advertising Partnership
 
Google to Invest $1 Billion for a 5% Stake in AOL
 
Companies to Collaborate on Online Video Offering and Make More AOL Content Available to Google Users
 
Google Talk Instant Messaging Software to Communicate With AIM Users
 
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., NEW YORK, NY, and DULLES, Va., December 20, 2005 - Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) and America Online, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Time Warner Inc. (NYSE: TWX), today announced that they are expanding their current strategic alliance. The agreement creates a global online advertising partnership, makes more of AOL's industry-leading content available to Google users, and includes a $1 billion investment in AOL by Google. This strategic alliance expands on the original relationship between the two companies launched three years ago.
 
Time Warner Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dick Parsons said: "We're very pleased to build significantly on our special relationship with Google in a way that will meaningfully strengthen AOL's position in the fast-growing online advertising business and help drive more advertisers to its Web properties. This agreement is key to fulfilling our commitment to realize the potential of AOL's very large online audience. As digital technologies continue to drive industries together, the great value and opportunity inherent in Time Warner's structure and array of premier businesses becomes increasingly clear. A critical piece of this strategic alliance will be our content, which we will be making more accessible to Google users."
 
Google Chief Executive Officer Eric Schmidt said: "AOL is one of Google's longest-standing partners, and we are thrilled to strengthen and expand our relationship. Today's agreement leverages technologies from both companies to connect Google users worldwide to a wealth of new content. We've also created a simple way for AOL Marketplace advertisers to buy and place search-related advertising across the AOL network. This partnership is an important next step for our companies."
 
Serving Users and Advertisers
 
Under the strategic alliance, Google and AOL will continue providing search technology to AOL's network of Internet properties worldwide. The agreement's broad range of new features for users and advertisers include:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AOL and Google have also agreed to extend the term of their existing European relationship, and, subject to mutual agreement, they may extend the AOL Marketplace internationally. In addition, Google, AOL and Time Warner may choose to expand the new partnership to Time Warner's other advertising opportunities.
Google Investment in AOL
 
Google will invest $1 billion for an effective 5% equity stake in America Online, Inc., allowing the company to participate in AOL's future success. Google will become the only shareholder in AOL other than Time Warner. Time Warner will retain management control and full strategic flexibility over AOL, while Google will have certain customary minority shareholder rights, including those associated with any future sale or public offering of AOL. Additional financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
 
Don Logan, Chairman of Time Warner's Media & Communications Group, said: "We look forward to working with Google to extend our successful paid-search partnership to other forms of advertising. In addition, we're excited about the potential for driving more traffic to our network of Internet properties. This agreement builds on our 2004 acquisition of Advertising.com and our other efforts to make AOL a more attractive advertising partner. We're confident that this partnership marks the next big step in making AOL an even more important player in online advertising."
 
Mr. Schmidt continued: "Our investment underscores our recognition of AOL as a valuable strategic asset and our desire both to contribute to and participate in its future success. We look forward to working with Dick Parsons and the management teams at Time Warner and AOL to take our already successful AOL relationship to even greater heights."
 
Jonathan Miller, AOL's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said: "AOL and Google have a very successful history working together, and this is an opportunity to take it to a new level that will benefit both companies and the customers we serve. We are excited about working with Google on the next generation of AOL products, while further expanding our presence on the Web. This is a great moment for AOL."

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On January 16, 2006, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "") with dMarc Broadcasting, Inc. (""), Enumclaw, Inc., and certain other parties. The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of Enumclaw, Inc. with and into dMarc, with dMarc continuing as the surviving corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary.
Merger Agreement
dMarc
 
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we will acquire all of the outstanding equity interests in dMarc, a privately held company, for total up-front consideration of $102 million in cash. In addition, subject to the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions described in the Merger Agreement, we will be obligated to make additional contingent cash payments from time to time if certain product integration, net revenue and advertising inventory targets are met over the next three years. The maximum amount of potential contingent consideration payable under the Merger Agreement is $1.136 billion over the next three years. Since these contingent payments are based on the achievement of performance targets, actual payments may be substantially lower. Substantially all of the payments pursuant to the Merger Agreement will be accounted for as part of the purchase price for the transaction.
 
A portion of the consideration will be placed in escrow to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of dMarc described in the Merger Agreement. We can also satisfy these indemnification obligations by offsetting losses we incur against contingent payments subject to certain limitations described in the Merger Agreement.
 
Consummation of the transaction is subject to customary conditions, including (1) the expiration or termination of the applicable Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period, (2) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties and (3) the absence of any material adverse effect on dMarc.
 
We expect the transaction to close in the first calendar quarter of 2006.
 
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement.
 
Safe Harbor Statement
 
This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including any statement regarding the amount of potential contingent payments that will actually be made and our expectation that the closing of the transaction will occur in the first quarter of 2006. Actual results may differ materially from our expected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations include the failure to (1) accurately estimate the amount of the contingent payments because of mistaken assumptions or predictions about the ability of dMarc's business to achieve the performance targets described in the Merger Agreement, (2) receive regulatory approval for the acquisition, (3) successfully integrate dMarc and its employees into our organization and achieve expected synergies, (4) compete successfully in this highly competitive and rapidly changing marketplace in which we have no significant previous experience and (5) retain key employees. These and other risks are detailed from time to time in our periodic reports that are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2005, June 30, 2005 and September 30, 2005.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  January 31, 2006 - Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) today announced financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2005.
 
"We are very pleased with our results for the fourth quarter as we achieved excellent performance across our businesses," said Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google. "We generated significant revenue growth in our core search and advertising business, driven by continued strength in traffic and monetization. We will continue to invest significantly as we develop innovative new products and as we extend our core technologies to new user access points and to different channels."
 
Q4 Financial Summary
 
Google reported revenues of $1.919 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, an increase of 86% compared to the fourth quarter of 2004 and an increase of 22% compared to the third quarter of 2005. Google reports its revenues, consistent with GAAP, on a gross basis without deducting traffic acquisition costs, or TAC. In the fourth quarter, TAC totaled $629 million, or 33% percent of advertising revenues.
 
Google reports operating income, net income and earnings per share (EPS) on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP measures are described below and reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure in the section below titled "About non-GAAP financial measures."
 
 
 
 
 
Q4 Financial Highlights
 
Google reported revenues of $1.919 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, representing an 86% increase over fourth quarter 2004 revenues of $1.032 billion, and a 22% increase over third quarter 2005 revenues of $1.578 billion. Growth over the third quarter was driven by expected seasonal strength in both traffic and monetization. Google reports its revenues, consistent with GAAP, on a gross basis without deducting traffic acquisition costs, or TAC.
Revenues 
 
- Google-owned sites generated revenues of $1.098 billion, or 57% of total revenues. This represents a 24% increase over the third quarter revenues of $885 million.
Google Sites Revenues
 
- Google's partner sites generated revenues, through AdSense programs, of $799 million, or 42% of total revenues. This is an 18% increase over network revenues of $675 million generated in the third quarter.
Google Network Revenues
 
- - Revenues from outside of the United States contributed 38% of total revenues, compared to 39% in the third quarter of 2005 and 35% in the fourth quarter of 2004. International revenues reflected the unfavorable impact caused by the appreciation of the U.S. dollar and stronger seasonal trends in the U.S. relative to the international business. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant from the third quarter through the fourth quarter, our revenues would have been $12 million, or 0.6%, higher. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant from 2004 through 2005, our revenues would have been $40 million, or 2.1%, higher.
International Revenues
 
, the portion of revenues shared with Google's partners, increased to $629 million in the fourth quarter. This compares to TAC of $530 million in the third quarter. TAC as a percentage of advertising revenues decreased to 33.2% in the fourth quarter from 34.0% in the third quarter, reflecting primarily the continued shift in our revenue mix from Google network revenue to Google-owned site revenue.
TAC - Traffic Acquisition Costs
 
GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter was $570 million, or 29.7% of revenues. This compares to GAAP operating income of $529 million, or 33.5% of revenues, in the third
Operating Income -
quarter. GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter includes a contribution of $90 million to the Google Foundation. Non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter was $718 million, or 37.4% of revenues. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $596 million, or 37.8% of revenues, in the third quarter. The favorable shift in the mix of revenues to a higher proportion of revenues from Google-owned sites was offset by significant investments in all areas of the business.
 
 In the fourth quarter, the charge related to stock-based compensation was $58 million as compared to $46 million in the third quarter. The increase in stock-based compensation was primarily related to Google stock units issued in 2005.
Stock-Based Compensation
 
Stock-based compensation in 2006 will be significantly greater than it was in 2005 as a result of our adoption of SFAS 123R effective January 1, 2006. We currently anticipate that dilution related to all equity grants to employees will be approximately 1% to 1.5% per year.
 
 GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $372 million as compared to $381 million in the third quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $469 million, compared to $437 million in the third quarter. GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.22 on 304 million diluted shares outstanding, compared to $1.32 for the third quarter, on 290 million diluted shares outstanding. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.54, compared to $1.51 in the third quarter.
Net Income
 
 Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter increased to 41.8% this quarter, and to 31.6% for the year, above our previously announced expectation of approximately 30% for the year. Because the proportion of total expenses allocated to our international operations was greater than we anticipated, more of our profits were taxed at a higher domestic tax rate; this resulted in a greater effective tax rate compared to our expectations. We expect our effective tax rate for 2006 to be approximately 30%.
Income Taxes
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the fourth quarter totaled $658 million as compared to $647 million for the third quarter. Free cash flow, an alternative non-GAAP measure of liquidity, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. In the fourth quarter we generated $413 million in free cash flow. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $245 million as compared to $293 million in the third quarter, and primarily reflect purchases of production servers and networking equipment and acquisitions of additional office space.
Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures
 
We will continue to invest significantly in capital expenditures in 2006. We expect the majority of the investment to be focused on IT infrastructure including servers, networking equipment, and data centers, as well as real estate and campus facilities.
 
 Adjusted EBITDA is another non-GAAP measure of liquidity and is defined as income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, SBC, IPR&D, and the contribution to the Google Foundation. Adjusted EBITDA increased to approximately $814 million in the fourth quarter from $672 million in the third quarter, or 43% of revenues for both periods.
Adjusted EBITDA
 
Reconciliations of free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities, the GAAP measure of liquidity, are included at the end of this release.
Fiscal Year 2005 Financial Highlights
 
 For the year ended December 31, 2005, Google reported total revenues of $6.139 billion, an increase of 92.5% over revenues of $3.189 billion in 2004. Revenue growth was attributable to both Google sites and Google network sites.
Revenue
 
 Revenue from Google sites increased 112.5% in 2005 to $3.377 billion as traffic to Google sites continued to grow and monetization improved.
Google Sites Revenues
 
 Revenue from the Google network increased 72.9% in 2005 to $2.688 billion due primarily to increased contribution from existing partners as well as the addition of many new partners to the AdSense for Search and AdSense for Content programs.
Google Network Revenues
 
 Revenues from outside of the United States contributed 39% to total revenues for the year compared to 34% in 2004.
International Revenues
 
 GAAP operating income in 2005 was $2.017 billion, compared to $640 million in 2004.

 GAAP net income for 2005 increased to $1.465 billion, from $399 million in 2004.

Forward looking statements
 
This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements relating to our plans to invest in our business, our expected stock-based compensation, the expected dilution related to equity grants to our employees, our anticipated effective tax rate for 2006, and planned capital expenditures. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, risks related to our international operations, our hiring patterns, the amount of stock-based compensation we issue to our service providers, the mix of our US revenue as compared to our non-US revenue, the inherent uncertain and complex nature of tax forecasting, the fact that we may have exposure to greater than expected tax liabilities, and our need to expend capital to accommodate the growth of the business, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions "Factors That Could Affect Future Results" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in our report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 and our report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, which are on file with the SEC and are available on our investor relations website at investor.google.com and on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, which will be filed with the SEC in the first quarter of 2006. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of January 31, 2006, and Google undertakes no duty to update this information.
 
About non-GAAP financial measures
 
To supplement Google's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, Google uses the following measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the SEC: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP operating margins, non-GAAP EPS, free cash flow, and adjusted EBITDA. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the
tables captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures" and "Reconciliations of non-GAAP liquidity measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures" included at the end of this release.
 
Google's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our core business operating results. Google believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing Google's performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Google's historical performance and liquidity and our competitors' operating results. Google believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making.
 
Google has computed its non-GAAP liquidity measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. Google expects to use consistent methods for computation of other non-GAAP financial measures introduced this quarter, including non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margins, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP EPS. The accompanying tables have more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.

Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure
On the morning of February 28, 2006, George Reyes, Chief Financial Officer of Google Inc., participated in the Merrill Lynch Internet, Advertising, Information, & Education conference. At this conference, Mr. Reyes made remarks regarding, among other things, revenue growth trends and expected sources of revenue growth.
We would like to clarify and provide further information on these statements. As we have stated before, monetization improvements will continue to be a key factor driving future revenue growth. We still see significant opportunities to improve monetization and intend to continue to focus our efforts in this area.
Moreover, as we have stated in our SEC filings, our revenue growth rate has generally declined over time and we expect that it will continue to do so as a result of the difficulty of maintaining growth rates on a percentage basis as our revenues increase to higher levels.
Safe Harbor Statement
This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements regarding future revenue growth and opportunities to improve monetization. Actual results may differ materially from our expected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations include competition, our ability to innovate, the growth of the market for internet advertising, our ability to penetrate foreign markets and general economic conditions. More information about potential risk factors is included in our report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, and from time to time in other reports that we file with the SEC.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On March 2, 2006, Google Inc., in connection with its Analyst Day, made available on the "Investor Relations" section of its corporate web site (www.google.com) certain historical financial information regarding three non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating expense and free cash flow, for each quarter in 2004 and 2005. George Reyes, Google's Chief Financial Officer will be discussing these financial measures during the CFO Presentation at Google's Analyst Day.
The information is contained in a document labeled "CFO Presentation  Non-GAAP Financials" next to the link to the webcast of the Analyst Day. The tables provided in this document contain details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to these non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures for each quarter of 2004 and 2005. A copy of the financial data made available on Google's corporate web site is furnished as Exhibit 99.01 to this Form 8-K.
Google's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of core business operating results.

Item 8.01. Other Events
On March 2, 2006, Google Inc. posted its Analyst Day presentations on its Investor Relations website, http://investor.google.com/. The initial posting inadvertently contained certain annotated comments not intended to be presented at Analyst Day, including the following statements:
"Our ads business for the moment is healthy and growing and we're on a strong trajectory
 
But strong competitors are attempting to aggregate traffic
 
"To really get down to brass tacks, we're going to: Execute well on our core ads projects to help us exceed the $9.5bn target (and backfill any AdSense partner loss) and drive advertiser satisfaction"; and
"In terms of estimating [stock-based compensation] charges for 2006, there are two things to consider:
 
 
The statements regarding $9.5 billion in 2006 ad revenue and AdSense margins were not speaker notes prepared for the Analyst Day presentation, and were inadvertently included in the Analyst Day slides. These statements were instead speaker notes prepared early in the fourth quarter of 2005 for an internal product strategy presentation. These notes were not created for financial planning purposes, and should not be regarded as financial guidance. Consistent with past practice, Google is not providing revenue guidance. In addition, the statement with respect to AdSense margins does not reflect Google's current expectations.
The statements regarding stock-based compensation were also inadvertently included in the Analyst Day slides. However, the statement regarding the stock-based compensation charge of $342 million, which relates to stock awards granted to employees and directors prior to 2006, is a materially accurate reflection of Google's current expectations.
Safe Harbor Statement
This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements regarding our revenue, AdSense margins and stock-based compensation charge. Actual results may differ materially from our expected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations include competition, our ability to continue to attract users to our web sites, our ability to attract web sites to our AdSense program, general economic conditions and those economic conditions specific to the Internet and Internet advertising, our ability to innovate and improve monetization, the growth of the market for internet advertising, our ability to penetrate foreign markets, geopolitical events such as war, threat of war or terrorist, and the forfeiture rate on our stock awards. More information about potential risk factors is included in our report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, and from time to time in other reports that we file with the SEC.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for (i) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Underwriter and all persons, if any, who control the Underwriter within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act or who are affiliates of the Underwriter within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act and (ii) the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either such Section, and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. In the case of any such separate firm for the Underwriter and such control persons and affiliates of the Underwriter, such firm shall be designated in writing by Goldman, Sachs & Co. In the case of any such separate firm for the Company, and such directors, officers and control persons of the Company, such separate firm shall be designated in writing by the Company. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.
(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 9(a) or 9(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand from the offering of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause 9(d)(i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause 9(d)(i) above but also the relative fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and of the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Shares shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriter, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the aggregate Public Offering Price of the Shares. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriter on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriter and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
(e) The Company and the Underwriter agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriter was treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 9(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, the Underwriter shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that the Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 9 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
 
(f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 8 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the Underwriter, any person controlling any Underwriter or any affiliate of the Underwriter or the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Shares.
10. . The Underwriter may terminate this Agreement by notice given by you to the Company, if on or after the Applicable Time (a) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on, or by, as the case may be, any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq National Market, the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Chicago Board of Trade, (b) trading of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market, (c) a material disruption in securities settlement, payment or clearance services in the United States shall have occurred, (d) any moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by Federal or New York State authorities or (e) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or any change in financial markets or any calamity or crisis that, in your judgment, is material and adverse and which, singly or together with any other event specified in this clause (e), makes it, in your judgment, impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offer, sale or delivery of the Shares on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus.
Termination
11. . This Agreement shall become effective upon the execution and delivery hereof by the parties hereto.
Effectiveness
If this Agreement shall be terminated by the Underwriter because of any failure or refusal on the part of the Company to comply with the terms or to fulfill any of the conditions of this Agreement, or if for any reason the Company shall be unable to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Underwriter for all out-of-pocket expenses (including the fees and disbursements of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Underwriter in connection with this Agreement or the offering contemplated hereunder.
12. . This Agreement may be signed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.

On April 20, 2006, Google is issuing a press release and holding a conference call regarding its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2006. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
This information shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
Google is making reference to non-GAAP financial information in both the press release and the conference call. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures is contained in the attached press release.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d) Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  April 20, 2006 - Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2006.
"Google had an exceptional quarter with strong growth and profitability, from both Google properties and the network," said Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google. "We are driving this growth through investments in our infrastructure and our people, product innovations that attract new users, and relationships with advertisers and partners around the world. The strength of our business model gives us the opportunity to invest in our business, allowing us to maintain and grow our market leadership."
Q1 Financial Summary
Google reported revenues of $2.25 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, an increase of 79% compared to the first quarter of 2005 and an increase of 17% compared to the fourth quarter of 2005. Google reports its revenues, consistent with GAAP, on a gross basis without deducting traffic acquisition costs, or TAC. In the first quarter of 2006, TAC totaled $723 million, or 32% of advertising revenues. Google reports operating income, net income, and earnings per share (EPS) on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP measures are described below and reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure in the section below titled "About non-GAAP financial measures."
 
 
 
 
compared to $58 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, which was also excluded from non-GAAP calculations. Plaintiffs' attorneys' fees related to the proposed Lane's Gift class-action lawsuit settlement are estimated to be $30 million. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the contribution to the Google Foundation of $90 million was excluded from the calculation of non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. Tax benefits related to SBC charges, the estimated plaintiffs' attorneys' fees and the contribution to the Google Foundation have been excluded from non-GAAP calculations. The tax benefit related to SBC was $27 million in the first quarter and $14 million in the fourth quarter. The tax benefit related to the estimated plaintiffs' attorneys' fees in the first quarter was $12 million. The tax benefit related to the contribution to the Google Foundation in the fourth quarter was $37 million. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP operating income, net income, and EPS are included at the end of this release.
Q1 Financial Highlights
Google reported revenues of $2.25 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, representing a 79% increase over first quarter 2005 revenues of $1.26 billion, and a 17% increase over fourth quarter 2005 revenues of $1.92 billion. Google reports its revenues, consistent with GAAP, on a gross basis without deducting traffic acquisition costs, or TAC.
Revenues 
Google-owned sites generated revenues of $1.30 billion, or 58% of total revenues. This represents a 97% increase over first quarter 2005 revenues of $657 million and an 18% increase over fourth quarter 2005 revenues of $1.10 billion.
Google Sites Revenues
-
Google's partner sites generated revenues, through AdSense programs, of $928 million, or 41% of total revenues. This is a 59% increase over network revenues of $584 million generated in the first quarter of 2005 and a 16% increase over fourth quarter 2005 revenues of $799 million.
Google Network Revenues
-
Revenues from outside of the United States contributed 42% of total revenues, compared to 38% in the fourth quarter of 2005 and 39% in the first quarter of 2005. Foreign exchange rates had an immaterial impact on sequential international revenue growth. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant from the first quarter of 2005 through the first quarter of 2006, our international revenues would have been $65 million higher.
International Revenues
-
, the portion of revenues shared with Google's partners, increased to $723 million in the first quarter. This compares to TAC of $629 million in the fourth quarter. TAC as a percentage of advertising revenues decreased to 32% in the first quarter from 33% in the fourth quarter.
TAC - Traffic Acquisition Costs
Other cost of revenues, which is comprised primarily of data center operational expenses, including depreciation expense, as well as credit card processing charges, increased to $181 million, or 8% of revenues, in the first quarter, compared to $148 million, or 8% of revenues, in the fourth quarter. Other cost of revenues also included stock-based compensation of $2 million in both the first quarter of 2006 and the fourth quarter of 2005.
Other Cost of Revenues
-
- Operating expenses, other than costs of revenues, were $607 million in the first quarter. Operating expenses included $284 million in headcount-related and facilities expenses, $112 million in stock-based compensation, and $50 million in advertising and promotional expenses, of which $25 million was related to distribution deals. In addition, stock-based compensation and estimated plaintiffs' attorneys' fees related to the Lane's Gift class-action lawsuit of $30 million are included in operating expenses, but excluded from non-GAAP calculations.
Operating Expenses
 In accordance with a new accounting rule, FASB Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, stock-based compensation is no longer presented as a separate line on our income statement. The stock-based compensation is now presented in the same lines as cash compensation paid to the same individuals. Stock-based compensation recognized in prior periods has been reclassed to conform with the presentation in the current period. In the first quarter, the charge related to stock-based compensation was $115 million as compared to $58 million in the fourth quarter. The increase in stock-based compensation was primarily related to the adoption of FAS 123R related to stock-based options expensing.
Stock-Based Compensation
For the full year, we expect stock-based compensation charges for grants to employees prior to April 1, 2006 to be $370 million. This does not include expenses to be recognized over the remainder of the year related to employee stock awards that are granted after April 1, 2006 or non-employee stock awards that have been or may be granted. We currently anticipate that dilution related to all equity grants to employees will be approximately 1% to 1.5% per year.
GAAP operating income in the first quarter was $743 million, or 33% of revenues. This compares to GAAP operating income of $570 million, or 30% of revenues, in the fourth quarter. GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation, the estimated plaintiffs' attorneys' fees related to the proposed settlement of the Lane's Gift lawsuit of $30 million in the first quarter, and the contribution of $90 million to the Google Foundation in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP operating income in the first quarter was $887 million, or 39% of revenues. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $718 million, or 37% of revenues, in the fourth quarter.
Operating Income
-
 GAAP net income for the first quarter was $592 million as compared to $372 million in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $697 million, compared to $469 million in the fourth quarter. GAAP EPS for the first quarter was $1.95 on 304 million diluted shares outstanding, compared to $1.22 for the fourth quarter, on 304 million diluted shares outstanding. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.29, compared to $1.54 in the fourth quarter.
Net Income
The share count of 304 million is as of March 31 and does not include 5.3 million shares issued in the offering completed early in the second quarter. The additional shares will be reflected in the second quarter 2006 share calculations and in subsequent quarters.
 Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 27%. We expect our effective tax rate for 2006 to be approximately 30%.
Income Taxes
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the first quarter totaled $825 million as compared to $658 million for the fourth quarter. In the first quarter of 2006, capital expenditures were $345 million. Free cash flow, an alternative non-GAAP measure of liquidity, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. In the first quarter we generated $480 million in free cash flow.
Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures
We expect that the growth rate in capital expenditures in 2006 will be substantially greater than the revenue growth rate for the year. We expect the majority of investment to be focused on IT infrastructure including servers, networking equipment, and data centers, as well as real estate and campus facilities.
In accordance with FAS 123R, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, which totaled $77 million in the first quarter, are now classified as cash flow from financing activities, rather than as a cash flow from operating activities. This requirement will reduce the amounts we record as net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow, and will increase the amount we record as net cash provided by financing activities. Total cash flow will remain unchanged from what would have been reported under prior accounting rules.
Reconciliations of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, the GAAP measure of liquidity, are included at the end of this release.
 As of March 31, 2006, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $8.43 billion. This balance does not reflect the additional $2.07 billion raised in the offering that closed in early April.
Cash
We also completed the investment of $1 billion in AOL in early April, and the balance of $8.43 billion does not reflect the impact of the cash investment.
On a worldwide basis, Google employed 6,790 full-time employees as of March 31, 2006, up from 5,680 full time employees as of December 31, 2005.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements relating to our plans to invest in our business, our expected stock-based compensation, the expected dilution related to equity grants to our employees, our anticipated effective tax rate for 2006, and planned capital expenditures. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, risks related to our international operations, our hiring patterns, the amount of stock-based compensation we issue to our service providers, the mix of our US revenue as compared to our non-US revenue, the uncertain and complex nature of tax forecasting, the fact that we may have exposure to greater than expected tax liabilities, and our need to expend capital to accommodate the growth of the business, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions "Factors That Could Affect Future Results" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations," in our report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, which is on file with the SEC and is available on our investor relations website at investor.google.com and on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, which will be filed with the SEC in the second quarter of 2006. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of April 20, 2006, and Google undertakes no duty to update this information.
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement Google's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, Google uses the following measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the SEC: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP operating margins, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures" and "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow" included at the end of this release.
Google's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our core business operating results. Google believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing Google's performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to Google's historical performance and liquidity and our competitors' operating results. Google believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making.
Google has computed its non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On June 9, 2006, Google Inc. ("Google") entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with WXII/Amphitheatre Realty, L.L.C., WXIII/Crittenden Realty A/B, L.L.C., WXIII/Crittenden Realty C, L.L.C. and WXIII/Crittenden Realty D, L.L.C. (collectively, the "Sellers"). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Google has agreed to purchase from the Sellers all of their leasehold title to the land together with all privileges, rights, and easements as well as all right, title and interest in and to the buildings and/or appurtenances belonging to such land located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway and 1200-1500 Crittenden Lane, Mountain View, California (collectively referred to as the "Property"), totaling approximately 978,066 square feet. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement, the purchase price for the Property will be $319 million, of which $10 million was placed into escrow by Google on June 9, 2006.
The ownership of the Property is subject to ground leases with the City of Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California (collectively, the "Ground Lease"). In connection with the purchase of the Property, Google has agreed to assume from the Sellers the Sellers' rights and obligations under the Ground Lease. The Ground Lease related to 1600 Amphitheatre contains an initial term expiring in 2050 with four options to extend the term for additional periods of ten years each. Rent payments under the 1600 Amphitheatre Ground Lease will be approximately $140,000 per month and will increase by 4% each year thereafter. In addition, rent payments under the 1600 Amphitheatre Ground Lease will be readjusted every ten years such that the annual rent equals 7% of the then-current fair market value. Additionally, the Ground Lease related to 1200-1500 Crittenden Lane contains an initial term expiring in 2051 with four options to extend the term for additional periods of ten years each. Rent payments under the 1200-1500 Crittenden Lane Ground Lease will be approximately $175,000 per month will increase by 4% each year thereafter. In addition, rent payments under the 1200-1500 Crittenden Lane Ground Lease will be readjusted every ten years such that the annual rent equals 7% of the then-current fair market value.
In addition to customary closing conditions, the purchase of the Property is subject to (1) the approval by the bankruptcy court overseeing Silicon Graphics, Inc.'s ("SGI") bankruptcy action of a settlement agreement between SGI and the Sellers (the "SGI Agreement) relating to certain commercial leases on the Property and (2) the written consent by the City of Mountain View of the assignment of the Ground Lease by the Sellers to Google. If the bankruptcy court approves the SGI Agreement, Google expects the transaction to close no later than June 30, 2006; provided, however, that the Sellers may extend the closing date for a period of up to fifteen days in order to satisfy certain closing conditions. Google provides no assurance that the bankruptcy court will approve the SGI Agreement or that the other closing conditions will be satisfied, and therefore Google provides no assurance that it will complete the purchase of the Property.
Prior to entering into the Purchase Agreement, Google subleased certain office space at 1600 Amphitheatre from SGI, subject to a master commercial lease between SGI and the Sellers.

Exhibit 99.1
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  July 20, 2006 - Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2006.
"Google grew at an impressive pace during a seasonally slower quarter," said Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google. "We continue to deliver valuable new products and services to users around the world through our partnerships and investments in our business. Our strong performance results from our clear focus on increasing the quality of user experience, particularly in search and ads."
 
Q2 Financial Summary
Google reported revenues of $2.46 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, an increase of 77% compared to the second quarter of 2005 and an increase of 9% compared to the first quarter of 2006. Google reports its revenues, consistent with GAAP, on a gross basis without deducting traffic acquisition costs, or TAC. In the second quarter of 2006, TAC totaled $785 million, or 32% of advertising revenues.
Google reports operating income, net income, and earnings per share (EPS) on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP measures are described below in the section titled "About non-GAAP financial measures" and are reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure in the accompanying financial tables.
 
 
 
 
 
Q2 Financial Highlights 
- Google reported revenues of $2.46 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, representing a 77% increase over second quarter 2005 revenues of $1.38 billion and a 9% increase over first quarter 2006 revenues of $2.25 billion. Google reports its revenues, consistent with GAAP, on a gross basis without deducting traffic acquisition costs, or TAC.
Revenues
Google-owned sites generated revenues of $1.43 billion, or 58% of total revenues. This represents a 94% increase over second quarter 2005 revenues of $737 million and a 10% increase over first quarter 2006 revenues of $1.30 billion.
Google Sites Revenues
-
Google's partner sites generated revenues, through AdSense programs, of $997 million, or 41% of total revenues. This is a 58% increase over network revenues of $630 million generated in the second quarter of 2005 and a 7% increase over first quarter 2006 revenues of $928 million.
Google Network Revenues
-
Revenues from outside of the United States contributed 42% of total revenues, compared to 42% in the first quarter of 2006 and 39% in the second quarter of 2005. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant from the first quarter through the second quarter of 2006, our revenues would have been $26 million lower. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant from the second quarter of 2005 through the second quarter of 2006, our revenues would have been $18 million higher.
International Revenues
-
, the portion of revenues shared with Google's partners, increased to $785 million in the second quarter. This compares to TAC of $723 million in the first quarter. TAC as a percentage of advertising revenues remained flat at 32% from the first quarter to the second quarter.
TAC - Traffic Acquisition Costs
Other cost of revenues, which is comprised primarily of data center operational expenses, as well as credit card processing charges, increased to $204 million, or 8% of
Other Cost of Revenues
-
 
revenues, in the second quarter, compared to $181 million, or 8% of revenues, in the first quarter. Other cost of revenues also included stock-based compensation of $2 million in the second quarter, compared to $2 million in the first quarter of 2006.
- Operating expenses, other than cost of revenues, were $652 million in the second quarter. Operating expenses included $342 million in headcount-related and facilities expenses, $107 million in stock-based compensation, and $49 million in advertising and promotional expenses, of which $24 million was related to certain distribution deals. In addition, stock-based compensation is included in operating expenses, but excluded from non-GAAP calculations.
Operating Expenses
 In the second quarter, the total charge related to stock-based compensation was $109 million as compared to $115 million in the first quarter.
Stock-Based Compensation
For the full year, we expect stock-based compensation charges for grants to employees prior to July 1, 2006 to be $375 million. This does not include expenses to be recognized over the remainder of the year related to employee stock awards that are granted after July 1, 2006 or non-employee stock awards that have been or may be granted. We currently anticipate that dilution related to all equity grants to employees will be approximately 1% to 1.5% per year.
- GAAP operating income in the second quarter was $815 million, or 33% of revenues. This compares to GAAP operating income of $743 million, or 33% of revenues, in the first quarter. GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation in the first and second quarters and plaintiffs' attorneys' fees related to a legal settlement of $30 million in the first quarter. Non-GAAP operating income in the second quarter was $925 million, or 38% of revenues. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $887 million, or 39% of revenues, in the first quarter.
Operating Income
 GAAP net income for the second quarter was $721 million as compared to $592 million in the first quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $772 million, compared to $697 million in the first quarter. GAAP EPS for the second quarter was $2.33 on 310 million diluted shares outstanding, compared to $1.95 for the first quarter, on 304 million diluted shares outstanding. Non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter was $2.49, compared to $2.29 in the first quarter.
Net Income
 Our effective tax rate was 26% for the second quarter and the six months ended June 30, 2006. We currently anticipate that our effective tax rate for the full year will be at or below 30%.
Income Taxes
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the second quarter totaled $841 million as compared to $825 million for the first quarter. In the second quarter of 2006, capital expenditures were $699 million, including $319 million related to real estate purchases in Mountain View, CA. Free cash flow, an alternative non-GAAP measure of liquidity, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. In the second quarter, free cash flow was $142 million.
Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures
 
We expect that the growth rate in capital expenditures in 2006 will be substantially greater than the revenue growth rate for the year. We expect the majority of investment to be focused on IT infrastructure including servers, networking equipment, and data centers, as well as real estate and campus facilities.
A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, the GAAP measure of liquidity, is included at the end of this release.
 As of June 30, 2006, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $9.82 billion. This balance reflects the net proceeds of $2.06 billion from the public offering that closed in early April as well as the impact of the cash investment of $1 billion in AOL in early April.
Cash
On a worldwide basis, Google employed 7,942 full-time employees as of June 30, 2006, up from 6,790 full time employees as of March 31, 2006.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements relating to our plans to invest in our business, our expected stock-based compensation, the expected dilution related to equity grants to our employees, our anticipated tax rate for 2006, and our expectation that the growth rate in our capital expenditures will be substantially greater than our revenue growth rate for the year. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, risks related to our hiring patterns, the amount of stock-based compensation we issue to our service providers, the uncertain and complex nature of tax forecasting, the fact that we may have exposure to greater than expected tax liabilities, and our need to expend capital to accommodate the growth of the business, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions "Risk Factors" and
 
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in our report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, which is on file with the SEC and is available on our investor relations website at investor.google.com and on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, which will be filed with the SEC in August 2006. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of July 20, 2006, and Google undertakes no duty to update this information.
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following measures defined by the SEC as non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP operating margins, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures" and "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow" included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our "core business operating results," primarily meaning our operating performance from a cash perspective. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making.
. Non-GAAP operating income is defined as operating income minus stock-based compensation and the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees related to a legal settlement of $30 million in the first quarter of 2006. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenues. Google considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors because they exclude a one-time event (i.e. the settlement of a legal matter) that is not part of our core business operating results. By excluding these one-time events, management and investors are better able to compare our core operating results over multiple periods.
Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin
 
Similarly, these non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of stock-based compensation so that Google's management and investors can compare Google's core business operating results over multiple periods in a manner that is not distorted by Google's recent adoption of FAS 123R in fiscal year 2006. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use when adopting FAS 123R, Google's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation allows investors to make more meaningful comparisons between Google's core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing Google's management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Google's own core business operating results over different periods of time. A limitation of using non-GAAP operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP is that non-GAAP operating income excludes some costs, namely, stock-based compensation, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Google's business. Management compensates for this limitation by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP.
 Non-GAAP net income is defined as net income minus stock-based compensation, the gains from the sale of our investment in Baidu in the second quarter of 2006 and the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees related to a legal settlement of $30 million in the first quarter of 2006. Non-GAAP EPS is defined as non-GAAP net income divided by weighted average shares outstanding as of June 30, 2006. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that Google uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a complete picture of our core business operating results, we exclude from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS the tax effects associated with stock-based compensation, the gains from the sale of our investment in Baidu in the second quarter of 2006 and the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees related to a legal settlement of $30 million in the first quarter of 2006. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses and gains had on our operating results. A limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not include all items that impact Google's net income and net income per share for the period. Management compensates for this limitation by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS together with net income and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP .
Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS.
. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions and
Free cash flow
 
strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period as it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of its cash flow statement and under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in its Form 10-Q.
Google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
The accompanying tables have more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Senior Executive Bonus Plan
On October 4, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a Senior Executive Bonus Plan for 2006 (the "Plan"), which is a variable cash incentive program designed to motivate participants to achieve our financial and other performance objectives, and to reward them when those objectives are met. All of our executive officers (excluding our Chief Executive Officer and our Presidents) are eligible to be considered for participation in the Plan at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Target bonuses vary based on the executive's salary, and the amount of target bonus actually paid to individual employees will be based on the achievement of (i) certain individual performance objectives tailored to each executive's role at Google and (ii) certain performance objectives tied to our annual revenue and operating profit; provided that other financial goals may be assessed as determined appropriate by our Board of Directors.
This brief description of the Plan is qualified by reference to the 2006 Senior Executive Bonus Plan attached as Exhibit 10.16 to this report.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 10.16
Summary
Google's 2006 Senior Executive Bonus Plan (the "") is a variable cash incentive program designed to motivate participants to achieve the company's financial and other performance objectives and to reward them for their achievements when those objectives are met.
Plan
Eligibility
Participants are approved solely at the discretion of the Board of Directors. All executive officers except for our CEO and Presidents are eligible to be considered for participation. No person is automatically entitled to participate in the Plan in any year, and any eligible participant may choose not to participate in the Plan in any year for any reason.
Administration
The Board of Directors or a committee appointed by the Board of Directors (the "") is ultimately responsible for administering the Plan. The Administrator has all powers and discretion necessary or appropriate to review and approve the Plan and its operation, including, but not limited to, the power to (a) determine which eligible participants shall be granted bonus awards, (b) prescribe the terms and conditions of bonus awards, (c) interpret the Plan, (d) adopt rules for the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan as are consistent therewith, and (e) interpret, amend or revoke any such rules. All determinations and decisions made by the Administrator and any delegate of the Administrator shall be final, conclusive, and binding on all persons, and shall be given the maximum deference permitted by law. The Administrator, in its sole discretion and on such terms and conditions as it may provide, may delegate all or part of its authority and powers under the Plan to one or more directors, officers and/or managers of the company. The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may amend or terminate the Plan, or any part thereof, at any time and for any reason.
Administrator
Award Determination
The Administrator, in its sole discretion, will approve target bonuses for each participant. Bonuses will be calculated using a formula that includes: (a) the executive's salary, (b) the executive's target bonus, (c) an "," and (d) a "." Multipliers become higher with higher levels of achievement and are determined as follows:
Individual Multiplier
Company Multiplier
The Individual Multiplier
For each participant in the Plan, the Administrator approves an Individual Multiplier that reflects the participant's contributions relative to individual performance expectations for the performance period. Individual performance expectations vary to reflect each executive's role in the company. An "on target" assessment yields a 100% multiplier.
The Company Multiplier
The Administrator approves a Company Multiplier for all participants by assessing Google's financial performance against pre-established annual goals for revenue and operating profit; provided that other financial goals may be assessed as determined appropriate by the Board of Directors. An "on target" assessment yields a 100% multiplier.
Award Payouts
Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, bonuses will be paid on an annual basis, typically in February, and the bonus period is currently Google's fiscal year period. Actual bonuses payable for 2006, if any, will vary to reflect the amount by which each target is exceeded or missed and are not currently determinable. The maximum bonus that any participant may receive under the Plan in 2006 is $3 million.

ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
On October 9, 2006, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "") with YouTube, Inc. (""), Snowmass Holdings, Inc., a newly formed and wholly owned subsidiary of ours (""), and certain stockholders of YouTube. The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of Merger Sub with and into YouTube, with YouTube continuing as the surviving corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary.
Merger Agreement
YouTube
Merger Sub
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we will acquire all of the outstanding equity interests in YouTube, a privately held company, for aggregate consideration of $1.65 billion of our Class A Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share (""). The number of shares of Common Stock to be issued in the merger will be based on the thirty day average closing price ending two trading days prior to the completion of the merger. A portion of the consideration will be placed in escrow to satisfy certain indemnification obligations of YouTube and its stockholders described in the Merger Agreement.
Common Stock
We have agreed, pursuant to a registration rights agreement that we entered into with YouTube stockholders concurrently with the Merger Agreement, to file a resale shelf registration statement covering the Common Stock to be issued in connection with the merger.
Consummation of the transaction is subject to customary conditions, including (1) the expiration or termination of the applicable Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period, (2) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties and (3) the absence of any material adverse effect on YouTube.
We expect the transaction to close in the fourth calendar quarter of 2006.
Michael Moritz, a member of our board of directors, is a general partner of Sequoia Capital, whose affiliates are stockholders of YouTube.
ITEM 3.02. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.
The issuance of the Common Stock to be issued in this transaction is expected to be exempt from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or Regulation D thereunder, as a transaction by an issuer not involving a public offering.
Item 1.01 of this Form 8-K contains a more detailed description of the Merger Agreement, and is incorporated into this Item 3.02 by reference.
Safe Harbor Statement
This Form 8-K includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding the expected timing for the closing of the merger.

Exhibit 99.1
Google To Acquire YouTube for $1.65 Billion in Stock
Combination Will Create New Opportunities for Users and Content Owners Everywhere
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., October 9, 2006 - Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) announced today that it has agreed to acquire YouTube, the consumer media company for people to watch and share original videos through a Web experience, for $1.65 billion in a stock-for-stock transaction. Following the acquisition, YouTube will operate independently to preserve its successful brand and passionate community.
The acquisition combines one of the largest and fastest growing online video entertainment communities with Google's expertise in organizing information and creating new models for advertising on the Internet. The combined companies will focus on providing a better, more comprehensive experience for users interested in uploading, watching and sharing videos, and will offer new opportunities for professional content owners to distribute their work to reach a vast new audience.
"The YouTube team has built an exciting and powerful media platform that complements Google's mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful," said Eric Schmidt, Chief Executive Officer of Google. "Our companies share similar values; we both always put our users first and are committed to innovating to improve their experience. Together, we are natural partners to offer a compelling media entertainment service to users, content owners and advertisers."
"Our community has played a vital role in changing the way that people consume media, creating a new clip culture. By joining forces with Google, we can benefit from its global reach and technology leadership to deliver a more comprehensive entertainment experience for our users and to create new opportunities for our partners," said Chad Hurley, CEO and Co-Founder of YouTube. "I'm confident that with this partnership we'll have the flexibility and resources needed to pursue our goal of building the next-generation platform for serving media worldwide."
When the acquisition is complete, YouTube will retain its distinct brand identity, strengthening and complementing Google's own fast-growing video business. YouTube will continue to be based in San Bruno, CA, and all YouTube employees will remain with the company. With Google's technology, advertiser relationships and global reach, YouTube will continue to build on its success as one of the world's most popular services for video entertainment.
The number of Google shares to be issued in the transaction will be determined based on the 30-day average closing price two trading days prior to the completion of the acquisition. Both companies have approved the transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2006.

The company will host a conference call and webcast at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time (4:30 p.m. Eastern Time) today to discuss the acquisition.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  October 19, 2006 - Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2006.
"Our third quarter results are a testament to the strength of our network of advertisers and partners, as well as our continuing focus on users," said Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google. "We were particularly pleased with the contributions of our international business in a seasonally weaker quarter. In addition, we continued to forge significant partnerships with companies such as eBay, Fox Interactive Media, and Intuit that will be of great value to all involved."
 
Q3 Financial Summary
Google reported revenues of $2.69 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2006, an increase of 70% compared to the third quarter of 2005 and an increase of 10% compared to the second quarter of 2006. Google reports its revenues, consistent with GAAP, on a gross basis without deducting traffic acquisition costs, or TAC. In the third quarter of 2006, TAC totaled $825 million, or 31% of advertising revenues.
Google reports operating income, net income, and earnings per share (EPS) on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP measures are described below and are reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures in the accompanying financial tables.
 
 
 
 
Baidu have also been excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. The tax benefit related to SBC was $21 million in the third quarter and $26 million in the second quarter. The tax expense related to the investment gains from the sale of the Baidu investment in the second quarter was $23 million. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP operating income, net income, and EPS are included at the end of this release.
 
Q3 Financial Highlights 
Google reported revenues of $2.69 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2006, representing a 70% increase over third quarter 2005 revenues of $1.58 billion and a 10% increase over second quarter 2006 revenues of $2.46 billion. Google reports its revenues, consistent with GAAP, on a gross basis without deducting traffic acquisition costs, or TAC.
Revenues 
Google-owned sites generated revenues of $1.63 billion, or 60% of total revenues, in the third quarter of 2006. This represents an 84% increase over third quarter 2005 revenues of $885 million and a 14% increase over second quarter 2006 revenues of $1.43 billion.
Google Sites Revenues
-
Google's partner sites generated revenues, through AdSense programs, of $1.04 billion, or 39% of total revenues, in the third quarter of 2006. This is a 54% increase over network revenues of $675 million generated in the third quarter of 2005 and a 4% increase over second quarter 2006 revenues of $997 million.
Google Network Revenues
-
Revenues from outside of the United States contributed 44% of total revenues in the third quarter of 2006, compared to 42% in the second quarter of 2006 and 39% in the third quarter of 2005. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant from the second quarter through the third quarter of 2006, our revenues in the third quarter of 2006 would have been $19 million lower. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant from the third quarter of 2005 through the third quarter of 2006, our revenues in the third quarter of 2006 would have been $35 million lower.
International Revenues
-
, the portion of revenues shared with Google's partners, increased to $825 million in the third quarter of 2006. This compares to TAC of $785 million in the second quarter. TAC as a percentage of advertising revenues decreased to 31% in the third quarter from 32% in the second quarter.
TAC - Traffic Acquisition Costs
The majority of TAC expense is related to amounts ultimately paid to our AdSense partners, which totaled $780 million in the third quarter of 2006. TAC is also related to amounts ultimately paid to certain distribution partners and others who direct traffic to our website, which totaled $45 million in the third quarter of 2006.
 
Other cost of revenues, which is comprised primarily of data center operational expenses, as well as credit card processing charges, increased to $223 million, or 8% of revenues, in the third quarter of 2006, compared to $204 million, or 8% of revenues, in the second quarter. Other cost of revenues also included stock-based compensation of $2 million in the third quarter of 2006, compared to $2 million in the second quarter of 2006.
Other Cost of Revenues -
Operating expenses, other than cost of revenues, were $710 million in the third quarter. These operating expenses included $382 million in payroll-related and facilities expenses, $98 million in stock-based compensation, and $50 million in advertising and promotional expenses, of which $14 million was related to certain distribution deals.
Operating Expenses -
 In the third quarter, the total charge related to stock-based compensation was $100 million as compared to $109 million in the second quarter.
Stock-Based Compensation
For the full year, we expect stock-based compensation charges for grants to employees prior to October 1, 2006 to be $377 million. This does not include expenses to be recognized over the remainder of the year related to employee stock awards that are granted after October 1, 2006 or non-employee stock awards that have been or may be granted. We currently anticipate that dilution related to all equity grants to employees will be approximately 1% to 1.5% per year.
GAAP operating income in the third quarter of 2006 was $931 million, or 35% of revenues. This compares to GAAP operating income of $815 million, or 33% of revenues, in the second quarter. Non-GAAP operating income in the third quarter was $1.03 billion, or 38% of revenues. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $925 million, or 38% of revenues, in the second quarter.
Operating Income -
 GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2006 was $733 million as compared to $721 million in the second quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $812 million in the third quarter, compared to $772 million in the second quarter. GAAP EPS for the third quarter was $2.36 on 311 million diluted shares outstanding, compared to $2.33 for the second quarter, on 310 million diluted shares outstanding. Non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter was $2.62, compared to $2.49 in the second quarter.
Net Income
 Our effective tax rate was 29% for the third quarter. We currently anticipate that our effective tax rate for the full year will be at or below 30%.
Income Taxes
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the third quarter of 2006 totaled $1 billion as compared to $841 million for the second quarter. In the third quarter of 2006, capital expenditures were $492 million, the majority of which was related to IT infrastructure investments, including data centers, servers, and networking equipment. Free cash flow, an alternative non-GAAP measure of liquidity, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. In the third quarter, free cash flow was $512 million.
Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures
 
We continue to expect that the growth rate in capital expenditures in 2006 will be substantially greater than the revenue growth rate for the year.
A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, the GAAP measure of liquidity, is included at the end of this release.
 As of September 30, 2006, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $10.4 billion.
Cash
On a worldwide basis, Google employed 9,378 full-time employees as of September 30, 2006, up from 7,942 full time employees as of June 30, 2006.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements relating to the value of our partnerships with eBay, Fox Interactive Media, and Intuit, our plans to acquire YouTube, invest in our business, our expected stock-based compensation charges, the expected dilution related to equity grants to our employees, our anticipated tax rate for 2006, and our expectations regarding the growth rate in our capital expenditures. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, the failure to receive regulatory approval for our proposed acquisition of YouTube, the failure of the other closing conditions in our agreement to purchase YouTube to be satisfied, risks related to our hiring patterns, the amount of stock-based compensation we issue to our service providers, the uncertain and complex nature of tax forecasting, the fact that we may have exposure to greater than expected tax liabilities, and our need to expend capital to accommodate the growth of the business, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in our report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, which is on file with the SEC and is available on our
 
investor relations website at investor.google.com and on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2006, which will be filed with the SEC in November 2006. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of October 19, 2006, and Google undertakes no duty to update this information.
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP operating margins, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures" and "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow" included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our "recurring core business operating results," meaning our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature, such as gains from the sale of investments and the related tax effects of such non-cash charges. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income minus stock-based compensation. We define non-GAAP operating margin as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenues. Google considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of stock-based compensation so that Google's management and investors can compare Google's recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. We believe that, given our recent adoption of SFAS 123R, it is difficult for investors to evaluate our GAAP results of operations on a year-over-year
Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin.
 
basis because our GAAP results of operations for 2005 calculated our stock-based compensation expense in a different manner than that required under SFAS 123R. Therefore, investors cannot compare the year-over-year results of our recurring core business operating results unless we exclude these non-cash charges that result from two different accounting methods. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use when adopting SFAS 123R, Google's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between Google's recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing Google's management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Google's own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, non-GAAP operating income excludes some costs, namely, stock-based compensation, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Google's business. Second, stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Third, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP.
We define non-GAAP net income as net income minus stock-based compensation and, for the second quarter of 2006, the gains from the sale of our investment in Baidu, as well as the related tax effects of such items. We define non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average shares, on a fully-diluted basis, outstanding as of September 30, 2006. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that Google uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results, we exclude from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS the tax effects associated with stock-based compensation and the gains from the sale of our investment in Baidu in the second quarter of 2006. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses and gains had on our operating results. The same limitations described above regarding Google's use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS together with net income and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS.
. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that
Free cash flow
 
provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period since it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement and under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in its Form 10-Q.
Google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
The accompanying tables have more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.

ITEM 2.01. COMPLETION OF ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.
On November 13, 2006, we completed our previously announced acquisition of YouTube, Inc.

YouTube
Merger Agreement
In connection with the acquisition, we issued an aggregate of 3,217,560 shares, and restricted stock units, options and a warrant exercisable for or convertible into an aggregate of 442,210 shares, of our Class A common stock. The number of shares of Class A common stock issued and issuable by Google was calculated by dividing $1.65 billion less certain amounts (approximately $15 million) funded to YouTube by Google between signing and closing by the average closing price for the 30 trading days ending on November 9, 2006. Twelve and one-half percent (12.5%) of the equity issued and issuable pursuant to the Merger Agreement will be subject to escrow for one year to secure indemnification claims. A copy of the Merger Agreement is filed as exhibit 2.01 to this Form 8-K.
Michael Moritz, a member of our board of directors, is a general partner of Sequoia Capital, whose affiliates were stockholders of YouTube. The shares of YouTube stock held by these affiliates were treated in the acquisition in the same manner as shares of stock held by the other stockholders of YouTube.
ITEM 3.02. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.
The issuance of the shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement is exempt from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or Regulation D thereunder, as a transaction by an issuer not involving a public offering.
Item 2.01 of this Form 8-K contains a more detailed description of the issuance of shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and is incorporated into this Item 3.02 by reference.

Survival of Representations and Warranties
Fundamental Representations

Exclusive Remedy
9.4 .
Indemnification Claims
(a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, no Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover any Damages pursuant to the indemnification obligations set forth in Section 9.2 hereof unless and until the Company Stockholders Agent receives a written notice (a "") of a claim for indemnification under Section 9.2 (an "") (with a copy to the Escrow Agent) stating, to the then current Knowledge of Parent, (i) that a Parent Indemnified Party has actually suffered or incurred Damages for which such Parent Indemnified Party believes in good faith that it may be entitled to indemnification under Section 9.2, or believes in good faith that a Parent Indemnified Party could suffer or incur Damages for which such Parent Indemnified Party believes in good faith that it may be entitled to indemnification under Section 9.2, (ii) to the extent then known by the Parent Indemnified Party, a brief description, in reasonable detail, of the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to the Indemnification Claim (and the Damages, to the extent known, forming the basis of such Indemnification Claim), including to the extent then known by the Parent Indemnified Party the
Notice of Claim
Indemnification Claim
 
identity and address of any third-party claimant and copies of any formal demand or complaint, and (iii) the representation, warranty or covenant of this Agreement that may form the basis of such Indemnification Claim under Section 9.2. To be valid pursuant to this Section 9.4, a Notice of Claim relating to an Indemnification Claim under Section 9.2(a) must be received by the Stockholders Agent prior to the expiration of the representation or warranty forming the basis of such claim, and any delivery or attempted delivery of a Notice of Claim after such expiration date shall be void and of no force or effect. In the event that a Parent Indemnified Party shall deliver a Notice of Claim with respect to any claim that is not a Copyright Action but would constitute a Copyright Action if filed or instituted in any Court, such Notice of Claim shall not be effective unless and until a Copyright Action is filed or instituted in Court on or prior to the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date.
(b) After receipt of a Notice of Claim, the Stockholders Agent shall have thirty (30) Business Days following such party's receipt of the Notice of Claim in which to deliver notice of objection to such claim to the Parent Indemnified Party and the Escrow Agent. If no objection notice is given within such 30 Business Day period, then the Indemnification Claim set forth in the related Notice of Claim shall be deemed to be valid and indemnifiable pursuant hereto, whereupon the Escrow Agent shall deliver to such Parent Indemnified Parties (as allocated from the Escrow Shares then remaining in the Escrow Account pursuant to Section 9.4(d)) Escrow Shares equal in value (valued at the Company Closing Price) to the amount of the Indemnification Claim set forth in the Resolved Claim Notice. In the event that the Stockholders Agent shall deliver written objection to any Indemnification Claim set forth in a Notice of Claim within the foregoing 30 Business Day period, then no Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to any indemnification payment and release of Escrow Shares in respect thereof unless and until such Indemnification Claim is finally resolved by mutual agreement, Court Order or settlement. In the event that a Parent Indemnified Party and the Stockholder Agent shall mutually agree to resolve a disputed Indemnification Claim in favor of the Parent Indemnified Parties (or any of them), then the applicable Parent Indemnified Parties and the Stockholders Agent shall provide joint written notice (the "") of such offset to the Escrow Agent, whereupon the Escrow Agent shall deliver to such Parent Indemnified Parties (as allocated from the Escrow Shares then remaining in the Escrow Account pursuant to Section 9.4(d)) Escrow Shares equal in value (valued at the Company Closing Price) to the amount of the Indemnification Claim set forth in the Resolved Claim Notice.

(d) In the event Parent and the Stockholders Agent shall have instructed the Escrow Agent to deliver any Escrow Shares to a Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.4(b), such Escrow Shares shall be allocated by the Escrow Agent among the Escrow Shares of the Company Stockholders in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Shares.

provided, however
 
number of Escrow Shares initially deposited in the Escrow Account pursuant to ARTICLE 2 shall be the Parent Indemnified Parties' sole and exclusive recourse against the Company Stockholders in respect of the Company Stockholders' indemnification obligations under Section 9.2(c).

In the event that the Parent Indemnified Parties (or any of them) shall be entitled to indemnification under Section 9.2(a) in respect of any of the Fundamental Representations or for any fraudulent, intentional or willful breach of any representation of the Company in this Agreement, none of the Company Stockholders shall be required to directly indemnify any Parent Indemnified Parties, other than pursuant to the release of Escrow Shares allocated to such Company Stockholder from the Escrow Account, unless and until all of the Escrow Shares held in escrow on behalf of such Company Stockholder have been either released from the Escrow Account or allocated to an Outstanding Claim. For purposes of the foregoing, the "" means $1,650,000,000.
Aggregate Merger Consideration Value
(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Company Stockholders shall only be liable under the indemnification obligations set forth in Section 9.2 for 50% of any Damages that arise from the matters set forth in Section 9.6(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the indemnification obligation set forth in Section 9.2(c) is the Company Stockholders' sole and exclusive obligation, duty and potential source of liability, and Parent Indemnified Parties sole and exclusive right and remedy, with respect to any Copyright Action (or any claim that if filed or otherwise instituted in a Court would constitute a Copyright Action) regardless of whether such claim or matter would constitute a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of Company or any Company Stockholders under this Agreement, including Section 3.12(b).
(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the "Damages" for which the Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification under Section 9.2 hereof shall expressly exclude, and the Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover, any punitive damages, except to the extent such punitive damages are payable by any Parent Indemnified Party as a result of a third-party claim.

Several Obligations
9.9 .

10.6 .
Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration
(a) Any claim or dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement, or the interpretation, making, performance, breach or termination thereof, shall (except as specifically set forth in this Agreement) be finally settled by binding arbitration in the County of Santa Clara, California in accordance with the then current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association and judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator(s) shall have the authority to grant any equitable and legal remedies that would be available in any judicial proceeding instituted to resolve a dispute.
(b) Such arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator chosen by mutual agreement of Parent and the Stockholders Agent. Alternatively, at the request of either party before the commencement of arbitration, the arbitration shall be conducted by three independent arbitrators, none of whom shall have any competitive interests with the Parent or Stockholders Agent. Parent and Stockholders Agent shall each select one arbitrator. The two arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator.
(c) In any arbitration under this Section 10.6, each party shall be limited to calling a total of three witnesses both for purposes of deposition and the arbitration hearing. Subject to the foregoing limitation on the number of witnesses, the arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case may be, shall set a limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrator or majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, to discover relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrator, or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions for discovery abuses, including attorneys' fees and costs, to the same extent as a competent court of law or equity, should the arbitrators or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without substantial justification.
(d) The decision of the arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, as to the validity and amount of any claim shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement. Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or
 
order awarded by the arbitrator(s). Within 30 days of a decision of the arbitrator(s) requiring payment by one party to another, such party shall make the payment to such other party, including any distributions out of the Escrow Fund, as applicable.
(e) The parties to the arbitration may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction or other interim or conservatory relief, as necessary, without breach of this arbitration provision and without abridgement of the powers of the arbitrator(s).
(f) The parties agree that each party shall pay its own costs and expenses (including counsel fees) of any such arbitration, and each party waives its right to seek an order compelling the other party to pay its portion of its costs and expenses (including counsel fees) for any arbitration.
10.7 . As of the Effective Time, each Stockholder Party, for itself and on behalf of its heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the ""), does hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waive, release and forever discharge the Company and each current (as of the Effective Time) and former director and officer of the Company from any and all Claims that such Relevant Persons may have against the Company, a director or officer to the extent such Claims arise out of or relate to such Relevant Person's ownership of Company Stock or other Equity Interests in the Company or their status as a securityholder of the Company except for any breach of the Agreement or any Transaction Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, this is not intended to, and shall not constitute, a release of any Claims arising out of a Relevant Person's status as a director or officer of the Company). With respect to such Claims, each Seller Party hereby expressly waives any and all rights conferred upon him or her by any statute or rule of law which provides that a release does not extend to claims which the claimant does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the released party, including, without limitation, the following provisions of California Civil Code Section 1542: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."

(NASDAQ: GOOG) announced today that it has closed its acquisition of YouTube, the consumer media company for people to watch and share original videos. In connection with the acquisition Google issued an aggregate of 3,217,560 shares, and restricted stock units, options and a warrant exercisable for or convertible into an aggregate of 442,210 shares, of Google's Class A common stock. The number of shares of Class A common stock issued and issuable by Google was calculated by dividing $1.65 billion less certain amounts (approximately $15 million) funded to YouTube by Google between signing and closing by the average closing price for the 30 trading days ending on November 9, 2006. 12.5% of the equity issued and issuable in the transaction will be subject to escrow for one year to secure certain indemnification obligations.
"We are excited to have closed the acquisition in order to begin collaborating to offer the best in quality and depth of content, user experience and new business opportunities for our partners," said Eric Schmidt, Chief Executive Officer of Google. "YouTube and Google will together provide innovative and exciting services for our users that will add a new dimension to on-line media entertainment. We look forward to working with content creators and owners large and small to harness the power of the internet to promote, distribute and monetize their content."
"Google's expertise, technology leadership, and resources will provide us with the flexibility to innovate and build the best, most entertaining service on the Internet. In the coming months, we will roll out many new exciting features and programs to benefit the creativity and participation of our community," said Chad Hurley, CEO and Co-Founder of YouTube. "The community will remain the most important part of YouTube and we are staying on the same course we set out on nearly one year ago. We will continue to gather and listen to its feedback and are looking forward to the many opportunities that lie ahead."

On December 12, 2006, Google Inc. issued a press release announcing a new program that will enable employees to sell vested stock options. Under the new Transferable Stock Option (TSO) program, Google employees will be able to sell their vested stock options to participating financial institutions in an online auction as an alternative to the traditional method of exercising options and selling shares. The press release is attached to this Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1. In addition, attached as Exhibit 99.2 to this Form 8-K are a posting to the Google Blog about the TSO program and other documents linked to from the blog posting.

Exhibit 99.1
Google Inc. to Launch Transferable Stock Option Program for its Employees
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., December 12, 2006 - Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) announced today a program that will enable employees to sell vested stock options in an online auction. Under the Transferable Stock Option (TSO) program, employees will still be able to exercise their options, but will also be able to sell their options to financial institutions as an alternative.
This program represents an innovative way to compensate employees and will increase the efficiency of Google's equity compensation by increasing the per-option value of employee stock options. Google will amend the terms of eligible employee stock options to make vested options transferable. The auction will be managed by Morgan Stanley. Smith Barney will serve as the employee stock option administrator. Google is working with multiple financial institutions to participate as bidders in the auction.
The ability to sell options is not a novel concept - today people can buy and sell options to purchase Google stock and the stock of many other companies on the public markets. What is novel is that Google is extending this ability to trade options to employee stock options. If an employee chooses to sell options in the TSO program, he or she will use an internal online tool built by Morgan Stanley to sell them to the highest-bidding financial institution. The financial institutions buying the options will then likely hold them until maturity and then settle with Google.
Google's employee stock options typically have a ten-year term from the grant date. Under the TSO program, Google's employee stock options, upon transfer, will have a lifespan of the lesser of two years or up to the remaining term under the original grant.
Google expects this program will go into effect in the second quarter of 2007. Only stock options issued since Google's initial public offering will be eligible for this program, and Google's Executive Management Group may not participate in the program.
This program will not result in a change to the accounting method used for employee stock options. However, in the near term Google expects that the amount it recognizes as stock-based compensation will be greater than it would otherwise have been after the program goes into effect.
Google has discussed the TSO program with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Google will ensure the program complies with applicable securities laws.

About Transferable Stock Options
Posted by Allan Brown, Director, Recognition & HR Systems
We work hard to attract and retain the world's best talent in a number of ways, and a part of that is offering competitive compensation packages. We offer standard things such as competitive salary, cash incentives, restricted stock units and stock options. But we also aim to be innovative. So today we're announcing a new compensation program called Transferable Stock Options (TSOs).
As with most employee stock option programs, Google's program to date has allowed employees to do two things with their options. Upon vesting they can (1) hold them or (2) exercise them and then hold or sell the stock. With the new TSO program, employees will have an additional alternative: they can transfer (sell) their options to a financial institution through a competitive bidding process. The ability to sell options is not a novel concept  today people can buy and sell options to purchase GOOG stock and the stock of many other companies on the public markets. What is novel is that we are extending this ability to trade options to employee stock options.
Typically, employees get value from stock options by exercising them after vesting, and then selling the stock they get from the exercise at a higher price, provided the company's stock price has appreciated since the time of grant. With the TSO program, employees will also be able to sell vested options to the highest-bidding financial institution, which may be willing to pay a premium above the difference between the exercise price and the market price for Google stock (even when the exercise price is higher than the market price). The premium paid is for the time value of the options. More on that and how institutions would do this, and why, is .
here
1
Employees will still have the choice of simply exercising and then holding or selling the stock too. But if they choose to sell the options, they can use a simple online tool that will show them the best price a participating financial institution is willing to pay for their vested options in real time. With that tool, they'll be able to sell their vested options to the highest bidder.
In addition to increasing the value of every option employees receive, the TSO program makes the value of their options much more tangible. In the past, employees typically valued Google stock options based simply on the difference between their option exercise price and the current market stock price (called the intrinsic value). Since Google grants options with exercise prices that are at, or above, the market price of Google stock, many employees do not value options on the day they are granted. By showing employees what financial institutions are willing to pay for their options, it is made clear that the value of their options is greater than just the intrinsic value.
 
 
 
We aren't offering this program for everyone or for all stock options. Google's (EMG) may not participate, and only employee stock options granted after our IPO are eligible. We should also note that we've discussed this program with the SEC and we'll ensure it complies with applicable U.S. securities laws.
Executive Management Group
We've chosen Morgan Stanley to manage the auction of these TSOs between our employees and the multiple bidders, and we are working with multiple financial institutions to participate as bidders in the auction. We expect to have this program up and running in the second quarter of 2007.

Exhibit 99.2.2
The Market for TSOs
Employee stock options are typically not transferable, meaning that employees are limited to either holding or exercising (paying the strike price in exchange for shares) their options. But with the new Google TSO program, eligible Google employee stock options will be transferable to a participating financial institution.
Here's how it will work. Employees will use a company web tool to see the highest price offered by the participating financial institutions for their vested options. The bid price that institutions offer will depend on the strike price, current Google stock price, the volatility of Google stock, current interest rates, the life of the option and market conditions.
Upon transfer, the term of the option will generally be shortened to two years except in cases when the option life is less than two years (in which case the transferable life would be less than two years). Other terms of the option will also be adjusted to conform with market-standard provisions for traded options. For example, the options will no longer automatically terminate three months after the selling employee leaves Google.
Also, once the highest bidder receives the options, no transfers of the options to the public are permitted by the winning bidder. Competing bids will be set by the bidders, but we expect that they will be close to the public market trading prices of listed stock options with similar maturities.
Why would financial institutions bid for options given that they are not permitted to sell the options to the public? The answer is hedging. Buying these converted employee stock options is similar to buying a call option - sometimes referred to simply as a call.' The owner of a call is positively exposed to the direction of the stock price - meaning that he or she makes money if the stock price goes up and loses money if the stock price goes down. The winning bidder in the TSO auction will likely hedge their position in the Google options by short selling Google shares, which is a typical way to hedge a position in an option. By short selling, the winning bidder offsets the exposure it has in the call. The winning bidder will adjust this short position over the life of the option based on fluctuations in Google's stock price. Through this hedging process, the winning bidder expects to make a profit.

Exhibit 99.2.3
Google Employees Tom and Sally
Employee stock options give the employee the right to buy a certain number of shares of company stock at a set price, often called the strike price. For example, an employee might be given 100 options with a strike price of one dollar per share, vesting over four years. That grant entitles the employee to exercise vested options to buy company stock at that price, regardless of what the stock is trading at in the open market. Typically, stock options have value when the price of the stock in the open market has become greater than the strike price, meaning that when the options vest, the employee can buy the stock at the strike price and then sell the stock at the higher open market price. Employees may either exercise the options (buy stock at the strike price) and hold that stock, exercise the option and then sell that stock, or simply hold the vested option for as long as they like (for as long as the life of the option, the length of which is set when the options are granted).
Here's a hypothetical example of how the Google Transferable Stock Option (TSO) program would affect a couple of Google employees we'll call Tom and Sally.
Let's assume
 
 
 
Sally debates whether to exercise her options in the traditional manner or take advantage of the added choice in the new TSO program that allows her to sell the options to a financial institution. Using a special employee website for the TSO program, she sees the highest bid from the participating financial institutions, which is $150 per option. She compares this to what she would receive if she exercised her options and sold the underlying shares the traditional way, which is $100 per option (calculated by taking the current $500 market price and subtracting the $400 strike price). Since she is better off under the TSO program, she sells all 100 options under the TSO program and makes $15,000 (before taxes).
Tom didn't compare the gains he could make under the new program with what he could make exercising and selling his options in the traditional manner. So, he decides to exercise his options and sell the stock. In doing so, he earns $100 per share, or $10,000 total (before taxes), which is $5,000 less than Sally.
This example shows how the TSO program can provide an opportunity to earn a premium for employee stock options.

Exhibit 99.2.4
Accounting for TSOs
Google will account for employee stock options under this program the same way we account for options presently. That is, we will determine their fair values on the dates of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) pricing model and then recognize those amounts as stock based compensation as the options vest. However, as discussed below, the of stock-based compensation we expect to recognize for each option outstanding will be under the new program than it would have been otherwise.
amount
greater
All existing stock options granted after our initial public offering to employees other than our Executive Management Group (EMG) will be modified to permit their sale under this program. As a result of this modification, we must take a stock-based compensation charge equal to the difference between the value of the modified stock options and their value immediately prior to modification. That charge will be taken on the date we initiate the program  expected to be in the second quarter of 2007  for all vested options and over the remaining vesting periods for all unvested options. We intend to disclose our estimates of these amounts in the first quarter of 2007.
The fair value of each stock option we grant after we go effective with this program will be greater than it would have been under the existing program. This greater fair value is a function of a longer expected life for options given that, upon transfer, they will generally have a two year remaining (contractual) life whereas under the existing program they expire once they are exercised. So, if the period from the date of grant to the date of sale under the new program is about the same as our current estimate of nearly four years from the date of grant to the date of exercise under the existing program, then options under the new program will have a nearly six year expected life (the nearly four years until the date of sale plus the two year remaining contractual life once the options are sold). Accordingly, options under the new program will have a longer expected life, and, therefore, a greater fair value which will result in more stock-based compensation per option for accounting purposes.
It is important to note that as part of the TSO program we decided to truncate the contractual life of the options to a maximum of two years from date of sale. If the contractual life were not truncated, the value of the options would be much greater on the dates of grant and vest than they would be otherwise.
An inherent challenge with accounting for traditional employee stock option plans is that the fair value on the date of grant is determined using pricing models (such as BSM) that assume the options are transferable. However, because traditional employee stock options are not transferable, there is a disconnect between their value as determined using BSM - which, under the new accounting rules, we recognize as stock-based compensation as the options vest - and the value employees ascribe to their options on the date of grant. The TSO program diminishes this disconnect.

Exhibit 99.2.5
GOOGLE TRANSFERABLE STOCK OPTIONS PROGRAM
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS REGARDING GOOGLE'S PROPOSED TRANSFERABLE STOCK OPTION PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM IS NOT SCHEDULED TO LAUNCH UNTIL APRIL 2007. THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ARE BASED ON OUR CURRENT PLANNED STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM, WHICH MAY CHANGE. GOOGLE MAY MODIFY THIS PROGRAM AND, IF IT LAUNCHES, TERMINATE THIS PROGRAM AT ANY TIME IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION.
GENERAL PROGRAM QUESTIONS
What are Google Transferable Stock Options ("TSOs")?
Google TSOs are Google employee nonqualified stock options that, once vested, may be transferred ("sold") to financial institutions through an online auction. Under our current stock option program, Google employees have a choice of either (1) exercising their vested stock options and then selling or holding the stock, or (2) continuing to hold the options to purchase shares at a later date. The TSO program offers a third alternative: selling vested stock options to financial institutions.
How do these new stock options compare to regular stock options?
Traditional stock options are not transferable (except in limited circumstances at death)  they are only exercisable. TSOs can either be exercised like traditional options, or they can be transferred (sold). TSOs will be governed by the terms of Google's 2004 Stock Plan and the relevant option agreements, which will be amended as described below.
Why did Google create this program?
We want to permit Google employees to capture the "time value" of their options. Because the current option program does not allow the sale of employee stock options, employees are able to realize value from the options only by exercising them and then selling the stock at a price higher than the exercise price. With this program, employees will be able to realize not only the intrinsic value (the difference between grant price and market price for Google stock), but also the time value of their options. Financial institutions such as banks may be willing to pay a premium above the intrinsic value for many options because of the time value.
What is time value?
Time value is the value of the right to continue holding an option for potentially greater gains at a later date.
 
Google Inc.

p. 1
Who can participate in this program?
Only active Google employees who are not part of the Executive Management Group (EMG) can participate in this program.
Which options are eligible?
Only vested nonqualified stock options granted since Google went public (post-IPO) are eligible for this program.
How many post-IPO options are still outstanding?
As can be derived from Google's financial statements, as of September 30, 2006 there were approximately 6.6 million vested and unvested options outstanding that were granted since Google's IPO.
Why did you exclude EMG?
We believe that this position reflects the interests of our shareholders at this point. We feel that our current compensatory programs provide adequate incentives for our Executive Management Group.
Why aren't options granted before Google went public (pre-IPO) eligible?
We believe it is fair to exclude options granted before Google went public from eligibility since the purpose of the TSO program is not to create value for options that are already significantly in the money. Realistically, even if we allowed pre-IPO options in the TSO program, bidders would be willing to pay little, if any, premium beyond the existing intrinsic value for the rights to those options. For that matter, there are many post-IPO options for which investors may pay little, if any, premium.
Can employees participate in the program after their employment with Google is terminated?
Once employment is terminated, an employee will no longer be eligible to participate in the TSO program, even if their options are still exercisable under the traditional program.
Are employees required to participate in the program?
Participation in the TSO program is completely voluntary and employees may decide to participate or not to participate at any time.
Can employees sell some of their options and exercise others?
Employees are free to exercise their options or sell the options (or not) in any mix they choose.
 
Google Inc.
December 12, 2006
p. 2
Will employees get a better price if they sell options through Google's TSO program than if they exercised and immediately sold their options?
Generally yes. The TSO auction system allows a sale to occur under the TSO program only if the winning bidder offers a price equal to or greater than the intrinsic "in-the-money" value. Although there is no guarantee that the bidding financial institutions will pay a premium for an in-the-money option, historical market data suggests that they typically do. However, this will not be true in all cases in the TSO program. For example, for options that are very much in or out of the money (i.e., where the market price of Google common stock is much greater or much less than the grant price of the option), the time value could be so low as to be outweighed by the transaction costs of the TSO program. In addition, options with a remaining term of less than six months cannot be sold in the TSO program because, upon transfer, the remaining life is rounded down to zero.
Can you give me an example of what employee stock options would be worth under this program?
To get an idea of what bidders might offer Google employees for options with two-year lives at given strike prices, you can refer to what the market is paying for publicly traded 2-year "call options" .
today
1
For example, as of the close of trading on December 11
th
, 2006, two-year public market options with a "strike price" (also called "grant price") of $500 were trading at approximately $105 each. Since Google's stock price closed at approximately $484 on that day, these options were "underwater" - meaning they had no intrinsic value. In other words, the entire $105 was attributed to the time value of the options. On the same date, two-year public market options with a strike price of $300 were trading at approximately $225 each. This means that the market was willing to pay not only the $184 for the value realizable by exercising and selling today, but also a $41 premium for the time value.
We caution employees not to place undue reliance on the value of publicly-traded options when attempting to determine the value of their options under the TSO program. Although Google's TSO program is intended to mirror the public market, it will not be as efficient because there will be fewer market participants and slightly higher transaction costs. In addition, the market price for options is highly volatile and may fluctuate drastically. We make no representations as to what "fair value" should be. Also, Google employees should be aware that as options become more in or out of the money (i.e., as
 
 
Google Inc.

p. 3
the market price of Google common stock gets further from the grant price of the option), the time value of the option decreases and therefore the TSO program becomes less valuable.
Will this program be available in all countries?
We intend to make this program available to employees in all countries where Google grants options except in places where, due to local legal and/or tax implications, it would not benefit employees or the program would be impractical. While we do believe that we will be able to offer the TSO program in most countries where we grant options, we are still working through local legal and regulatory requirements in each country so that we can implement this program in as many places as possible. We will provide employees in each country with updated specifics between now and April.
When can employees start using this program?
We plan to launch the TSO program when the Q2 trading window opens in April 2007. Google employees will be able to log in to create and view their TSO account through an online system that Morgan Stanley has created for Google shortly before the program launches.
Will there be periods when Google employees cannot sell their options in the TSO program?
Yes. The TSO program will be active during regular NASDAQ trading hours when Google's trading window is open. When Google has material, non-public information, we will shut down the TSO program until the information is no longer material or the second business day after the information has been made public. Google employees will not be given advance notice of these shutdowns. When the TSO program is not active, Google employees may not sell their options under the TSO program, even under a 10b5-1 plan. See also "Does the TSO program affect an employee's ability to exercise options and sell the underlying shares in the traditional way?" below.
What is material, non-public information?
Information is material if a reasonable investor would consider it important in making a decision to buy, sell or hold Google securities, such a large acquisition or commercial deal. Information is nonpublic until it has been widely disseminated to the public market and the public has had a chance to absorb and evaluate it. Google employees may refer to Google's Policy Against Insider Trading for more information on what constitutes material, non-public information.
Why will the TSO program be shut down when Google is in possession of material, non-public information?
The registration statement Google is filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to permit the TSO program to operate may not be used when Google is in possession of material, non-public information. Therefore, the TSO program must be suspended when Google is in possession of material, non-public information. In practice, this means that Google employees will not be able to sell options using the TSO program in these periods.

Does the TSO program affect an employee's ability to exercise options and sell the underlying shares in the traditional way?
No, with one exception. As discussed above, Google will shut down the TSO program when Google is in possession of material, non-public information. During such time periods, Google will also black out Google employees from selling shares issued upon the exercise of options in the traditional way. Google will impose this restriction to help ensure that sales of Google stock by Google employees do not violate insider-trading laws and Google's Policy Against Insider Trading. If Google did not impose this restriction, there is a risk that a Google employee could be deemed to be selling Google stock during a period when the Google employee knew that the TSO program is shut down, which could be deemed material, non-public information. This restriction does not apply to sales of shares under a 10b5-1 plan (but it does apply to sales of TSOs under a 10b5-1 plan).
Who will buy the options?
Pre-qualified institutional investors will be bidding on all options that Google employees put up for auction.
Can employees sell options outside of Google's TSO auction process?
No, employees may not sell options outside of the TSO program.
What are the tax consequences when employees sell TSOs?
In the US, when employees sell TSOs, the amount they receive will be treated as compensation income to them in the year that they sell the TSOs. This income is of the same character as the income they would have received if they had exercised their options and immediately sold the underlying shares rather than sold their options through this new program. Google will withhold the same type of taxes on the compensation income they earn from the sale of TSOs as it would have if they had exercised their options and immediately sold the underlying shares rather than sold their options. The discussion above does not constitute tax advice, nor does it address any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign jurisdiction. Also, tax laws may change, possibly retroactively, so you should consult your tax advisor.

Is the TSO program affected by section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code?
We don't think so, but the regulations are not finalized yet. (For those of you who are not familiar with section 409A, it generally subjects certain discounted options to tax at the time of vesting, regardless of whether they are exercised or sold. Normal income taxes, an additional 20% penalty tax and other taxes can apply.) With respect to options that Google grants after the TSO program begins, there will be no section 409A tax so long as we grant the options at fair market value, which is what we do. With respect to options already outstanding at the time the TSO program begins, the existing IRS guidance under section 409A specifically permits the changes we will make to the options in connection with the TSO program without the options being deemed regrants for tax purposes, and thus the options would not be deemed discounted options subject to section 409A. More specifically, the proposed section 409A regulations permit changes to allow for transferability of certain options. Although the IRS is not yet issuing rulings under section 409A, we have been careful in structuring the TSO program to ensure that its adoption and operation will not create any section 409A issues for Google employees. The final version of the TSO program will be designed in a way so as to ensure compliance with the final regulations under section 409A (which will not be released until early 2006).
What are the tax consequences for employees who work for a Google entity outside the U.S.?
Since TSOs are a new concept in every country, the tax implications associated with this new program are not entirely certain. We are working with outside tax counsel to identify the tax implications in every country that Google currently issues options; and in the countries where we do offer TSOs, we generally believe that the tax consequences will be similar to the tax consequences of exercising ordinary options. However, this is subject to additional regulatory review. For Google employees subject to US taxes outside of the US, Google will provide additional tax information at a later time.
Which financial institutions are participating in this program?
Morgan Stanley will serve as Google's TSO auction manager and will settle all transactions between Google employees and bidders. Smith Barney will serve as the employee stock option administrator. Google is working with multiple financial institutions to participate as bidders in the auctions.
Do I have to open a Morgan Stanley or other brokerage account?
No, you will create an online TSO account, but will not be required to open a Morgan Stanley or other brokerage account.

What if others want to participate? Are there any financial institutions that are not eligible to be a part of the auction?
Google anticipates allowing additional financial institutions to participate in the TSO program. All participants must be able to provide continuous, automated bids for all Google options in the TSO program, and must update their systems to interface with the TSO system. Admission will be at Google's sole discretion.
How are bid prices for options determined?
All participating bidders will be required to bid on all of the options offered for sale as a condition of participation in Google's TSO program so that all Google employees get the benefit of competitive pricing on their options, even if they are selling only one option. Institutional investors use their own proprietary option pricing models to determine the fair value of each option based on the option's strike price, term (which will be up to two years under Google's TSO program; all options with a duration of greater than two years will be shortened to two years), market interest rates, stock price volatility, and market conditions at the moment the bid is made. We expect that bid prices will change throughout the trading day just like bid prices for shares of stock on the NASDAQ change throughout the day to reflect changing valuation assumptions.
Can an employee specify in advance the price at which they want to sell their options?
Yes. If an employee wants to sell his/her options at a certain price, the employee can submit a limit order. The option will be sold at a minimum of that price as long as one of the bidders is willing to pay at least that much for the option(s). Limits can be set to expire at the end of the trading day or at the end of a trading window. A market or limit order can be made at any time during an open trading window, although the trade cannot be effected unless the auction is open. There is no guarantee that limit orders will be filled, and, as discussed above, the TSO program may shut down from time to time without prior notice.
Can employees sell vested, "underwater" stock options in this program?
Yes, financial institutions do place value on "underwater" stock options (i.e., those with strike prices above the current market price of the stock) and we expect them to bid on underwater options. However, if an option is significantly underwater and/or the option has only a limited remaining life (e.g., if the option is sold nine years and five months after grant), the bid price may be very low or even zero.
How does the TSO program affect Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans?
A 10b5-1 plan may be used to sell options through the TSO program. Google is modifying its form 10b5-1 plan to accommodate TSO sales, and will make this revised form available before the trading window opens on February 5, 2007. Here are important points regarding 10b5-1 plans and the TSO program:

What is the benefit of a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan if Google will shut down the TSO program (including trading under a 10b5-1 plan) when Google in possession of material, non-public information?
There are a couple reasons why a Google Employee may still wish to enter into a 10b5-1 Plan.
First, a 10b5-1 plan will still permit you to exercise and sell your options the traditional way regardless of whether we are in our ordinary quarterly blackout periods or in a special blackout period during which the TSO Program has been suspended. So

December 12, 2006
p. 8
Second, as discussed above, Google will shut down the TSO program when Google is in possession of material, non-public information. However. determining whether an item is material is a difficult, fact intensive, subjective analysis that can be second-guessed in hindsight. So, Google may be in possession of information that it deems not to be material and will continue to let the TSO program operate, even though another person might determine the information is material, especially if applying hindsight. (That's why our insider trading policy says that Google employees cannot rely on Google's determination of whether an item is material when deciding to buy or sell any Google security; the ultimate decision of whether to do so rests with each Google employee.) For this reason, a 10b5-1 plan (even if it just contemplates sales under the TSO Program when the Program is active) could be helpful to a Google employee in rebutting a claim that he or she fraudulently sold his options under the TSO Program while in possession of material non-public information.
Please keep in mind that the decision as to whether to adopt a 10b5-1 plan (or not) is a complicated one, and depends on the each individual's particular circumstances, and also on any requirements imposed by each individual's plan broker. Google cannot give any Google employee advice on whether to enter into, amend or terminate a 10b5-1 plan. We encourage you to consult your personal advisors and broker regarding the TSO program and 10b5-1 plans.
ACCOUNTING, INVESTOR & OTHER FINANCE QUESTIONS
Do the new stock options have any changes in their terms?
When the options are sold to a bidder under the TSO program, three changes occur:
1. The remaining life is shortened to two years unless the remaining life is less than two years. If the remaining life is less than two years, then the transferable life is further reduced from two years in six-month increments (e.g., 18 months, 12 months, six months) until the remaining transferable life is zero. For example, an option with a remaining life of 23 months will, upon sale in the TSO program, have an 18-month life.
2. The forfeiture provisions related to the employee's employment with Google are removed.
 
Google Inc.
December 12, 2006
p. 9
3. We anticipate the anti-dilution provisions will be changed to conform to market-standard provisions.
Why did you reduce the length of the option life upon transfer?
We shortened the term to adjust the time value of the transferred options so that they are, in our estimation, more closely aligned with our compensatory objectives when the option was originally granted. Because the value of the option is in part determined by its term, a shorter option term would decrease the time value that can be realized through the TSO program.
It was not Google's intent to eliminate the benefits of employees holding options altogether. Our intent was to give employee options more tangible value. The TSO program is available to employees who are willing to forgo some of the potential future value in order to get some value today.
How does the TSO program affect Google's accounting?
The TSO program does not change the way we will account for options, but it does increase the cost per option that we will recognize for accounting purposes because the fair value per option on the date of grant will be greater because the life of the option will be longer. The longer expected life results from the fact that upon transfer, the options are modified to have a two-year remaining life (generally) from the date of sale, whereas under the non-transferable option program options expire once they are exercised. Because we expect that options will be outstanding longer, they will have a greater fair value on the date of grant which will result in more stock-based compensation for accounting purposes.
expected
We intend to modify all existing stock options granted to employees other than EMG after our IPO to permit their sale under the TSO program. As a result of this modification, we will take a stock-based compensation charge equal to the difference between the value of the modified stock options and their value immediately prior to modification. That charge will be taken on the date we initiate the program  expected to be in the second quarter of 2007  for all vested options and over the remaining vesting periods for all unvested options. We plan to disclose the expected amount of this charge in the first quarter of 2007.
Is this program related to new accounting rules for stock options?
No, this program is not driven by accounting implications. Google is doing this to make equity compensation more efficient and understandable to employees. We expect our compensation costs per option to increase under this program to reflect the increase in expected life of each eligible option.
 
Google Inc.
December 12, 2006
p. 10
Will this affect earnings?
As discussed above, we will recognize more stock-based compensation per option than we would have otherwise for the foreseeable future after the program goes into effect.
What is the impact on shareholders?
The TSO program increases the efficiency of our equity usage. Under the TSO program, we expect that every option that is granted will be more highly valued by employees, while at the same time the TSO program will retain the advantage of leverage that stock options offer over other forms of equity compensation. We also believe this program enhances our ability to compete effectively for the best talent in the marketplace and therefore sustain our competitive advantage.
Have you discussed this program with the SEC?
We have discussed the TSO program with the SEC, and Google will ensure the program complies with applicable securities laws.
What will the financial institutions do with the options they purchase in the TSO program?
The financial institutions will not be allowed to further transfer the options they purchase in the TSO program to the public. We believe that the financial institutions will enter into hedging transactions with respect to the options they purchase in the TSO program. Specifically, the winning bidder in the TSO auction will likely hedge their position in the Google options by short selling Google shares, which is a typical way to hedge a position in an option. By short selling, the winning bidder offsets the exposure it has in the purchased option. The winning bidder will adjust this short position over the life of the option based on fluctuations in Google's stock price. Through this hedging process, the winning bidder expects to make a profit.
Will Google file a registration statement with the SEC in connection with the TSO program?
Yes. This registration statement will cover, among other things, the expected short-selling activities of the participating financial institutions after they have purchased TSOs. (See "What will the financial institutions do with the options they purchase in the TSO program?" above.) Google will not be a party to this short-selling activity.
What advantage do these options have over restricted stock grants?
Transferable stock options share some of the benefits of restricted stock by having immediate value at grant, but in addition have more upside potential since we typically grant options in higher amounts than we grant restricted stock. In addition, based on current tax treatment in the U.S. and most other countries where Google grants options, options generally offer better tax planning flexibility to the option holder. While taxes on

GSUs are generally due at vesting, taxes on option proceeds are not generally due until the holder chooses to exercise/sell the options and claim the gain as income or capital gain, depending on the holding period after exercise.
OTHER QUESTIONS
Has anyone done this before?
No, the TSO program is the first of its kind.
Isn't this what Microsoft and Comcast did? How is this program different?
No, there are many differences between what Google is doing and what Microsoft and Comcast did. For example, Microsoft and Comcast were one-time transactions to a single bidder. In contrast, the TSO program is ongoing, and options will be sold competitively through an auction system involving multiple bidders. This program is the first of its kind.
How is this different than what Cisco tried to do?
This program is very different. Cisco proposed creating a security in an attempt to measure the market value of options issued to employees for accounting purposes. The employee options themselves were unchanged and remained non-transferable. The TSO program makes options themselves transferable for the benefit of employees.
Why did you choose Morgan Stanley?
We chose Morgan Stanley based on their industry credentials, technology capabilities, and experience in building and operating Google's auction IPO system.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On January 31, 2007, Google is issuing a press release and holding a conference call regarding its financial results for the quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
This information shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
Google is making reference to non-GAAP financial information in both the press release and the conference call. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures is contained in the attached press release.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  January 31, 2007Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) today announced financial results for the quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2006.
"Our impressive performance in the fourth quarter demonstrates the continuing strength of our business model across Google properties and those of our partners," said Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google. "Our growing organization allows us to deliver ever increasing amounts of information and content to our users both through investments in search and ads as well as through strategic partnerships."
 
Q4 Financial Summary
Google reported revenues of $3.21 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2006, an increase of 67% compared to the fourth quarter of 2005 and an increase of 19% compared to the third quarter of 2006. Google reports its revenues, consistent with GAAP, on a gross basis without deducting traffic acquisition costs, or TAC. In the fourth quarter of 2006, TAC totaled $976 million, or 31% of advertising revenues. Google reports operating income, net income, and earnings per share (EPS) on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP measures are described below and are reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures in the accompanying financial tables.
 
 
 
 
In addition, in the fourth quarter, the 2006 R&D tax credit was enacted, which resulted in a $78 million benefit to our provision for income taxes. $43 million of this benefit pertained to the first three quarters of 2006 and is excluded from our non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter. Without these discrete items, our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2006 and for the full year 2006 was 24% and 26%, respectively.
 
Q4 Financial Highlights 
Google reported revenues of $3.21 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2006, representing a 67% increase over fourth quarter 2005 revenues of $1.92 billion and a 19% increase over third quarter 2006 revenues of $2.69 billion. Google reports its revenues, consistent with GAAP, on a gross basis without deducting traffic acquisition costs, or TAC.
Revenues 
Google-owned sites generated revenues of $1.98 billion, or 62% of total revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2006. This represents an 80% increase over fourth quarter 2005 revenues of $1.10 billion and a 22% increase over third quarter 2006 revenues of $1.63 billion.
Google Sites Revenues
-
Google's partner sites generated revenues, through AdSense programs, of $1.20 billion, or 37% of total revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2006. This is a 50% increase over network revenues of $799 million generated in the fourth quarter of 2005 and a 16% increase over third quarter 2006 revenues of $1.04 billion.
Google Network Revenues
-
Revenues from outside of the United States contributed 44% of total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to 44% in the third quarter of 2006 and 38% in the fourth quarter of 2005. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant from the third quarter through the fourth quarter of 2006, our revenues in the fourth quarter of 2006 would have been $18 million lower. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant from the fourth quarter of 2005 through the fourth quarter of 2006, our revenues in the fourth quarter of 2006 would have been $81 million lower.
International Revenues
-
 
 Aggregate paid clicks, which include clicks related to ads served on Google sites and our AdSense partners, increased approximately 61% over the fourth quarter of 2005 and approximately 22% over the third quarter of 2006.
Paid Clicks
, the portion of revenues shared with Google's partners, increased to $976 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. This compares to TAC of $825 million in the third quarter. TAC as a percentage of advertising revenues was 31% in both the fourth quarter and the third quarter.
TAC - Traffic Acquisition Costs
The majority of TAC expense is related to amounts ultimately paid to our AdSense partners, which totaled $916 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. TAC is also related to amounts ultimately paid to certain distribution partners and others who direct traffic to our website, which totaled $60 million in the fourth quarter of 2006.
Other cost of revenues, which is comprised primarily of data center operational expenses, as well as credit card processing charges, increased to $307 million, or 10% of revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared to $223 million, or 8% of revenues, in the third quarter.
Other Cost of Revenues -
Operating expenses, other than cost of revenues, were $862 million in the fourth quarter. These operating expenses included $493 million in payroll-related and facilities expenses.
Operating Expenses -
 In the fourth quarter, the total charge related to stock-based compensation was $134 million as compared to $100 million in the third quarter.
Stock-Based Compensation
We currently anticipate that we will launch our employee transferable stock options (TSO) program in the second quarter of 2007. Because all outstanding stock options granted under our 2004 Stock Plan after our initial public offering to employees other than our Executive Management Group will be modified to allow selling under the program, we expect to incur a modification charge in accordance with GAAP of approximately $90 million in the second quarter of 2007 related to vested options as of the end of that quarter and a charge of approximately $160 million over their remaining vesting periods of up to approximately four years related to unvested options.
The market value of our stock used to compute the above forecasted modification charges was $494 per share. The actual charge will be different to the extent the number of options outstanding at the time we launch the TSO program is different than our expectations, or to the extent the variables used to revalue these options, including the market value and volatility of our stock, are different.
Also, the fair value of each option granted under the TSO program in the future will be greater, resulting in more stock-based compensation per option.
 
Before these incremental charges related to the TSO program, we currently estimate stock-based compensation charges for grants to employees prior to January 1, 2007 to be approximately $621 million for 2007. This does not include expenses to be recognized related to employee stock awards that are granted after January 1, 2007 or non-employee stock awards that have been or may be granted. We currently anticipate that dilution related to all equity grants to employees will be at or below 2% per year.
GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter of 2006 was $1.06 billion, or 33% of revenues. This compares to GAAP operating income of $931 million, or 35% of revenues, in the third quarter. Non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter was $1.20 billion, or 37% of revenues. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $1.03 billion, or 38% of revenues, in the third quarter.
Operating Income -
 GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $1.03 billion as compared to $733 million in the third quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $997 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $812 million in the third quarter. GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter was $3.29 on 313 million diluted shares outstanding, compared to $2.36 for the third quarter, on 311 million diluted shares outstanding. Non-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter was $3.18, compared to $2.62 in the third quarter.
Net Income
 Our effective tax rate was 13% for the fourth quarter of 2006 and 23% for the full year 2006.
Income Taxes
In December 2006, Google entered into an Advanced Pricing Agreement ("APA") with the IRS in connection with certain intercompany transfer pricing arrangements. The APA applies to the taxation years beginning in 2003. As a result of the APA, we reduced certain of our income tax contingency reserves and recognized an income tax benefit of $90 million in the fourth quarter. This amount is excluded from our non-GAAP results for the quarter and for the year.
Also, in the fourth quarter, the 2006 R&D tax credit was signed into federal law, which resulted in a $78 million benefit to our provision for income taxes. $43 million of this benefit pertained to the first three quarters of 2006 and is excluded from our non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter.
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, defined as our income before income taxes divided into the sum obtained by adding the applicable aforementioned discrete items to our provision for income taxes, for the fourth quarter and for the year was 24% and 26%, respectively. Our effective tax rate will be greater in 2007 under the APA than it would have been without it. However, we expect our effective tax rate for 2007 will be at or below 30%.
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the fourth quarter of 2006 totaled $911 million as compared to $1 billion for the third quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2006, capital expenditures were $367 million, the
Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures
 
majority of which was related to IT infrastructure investments, including data centers, servers, and networking equipment. Free cash flow, an alternative non-GAAP measure of liquidity, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. In the fourth quarter, free cash flow was $544 million.
In 2007, we expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures.
A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, the GAAP measure of liquidity, is included at the end of this release.
 As of December 31, 2006, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $11.2 billion.
Cash
On a worldwide basis, Google employed 10,674 full-time employees as of December 31, 2006, up from 9,378 full time employees as of September 30, 2006.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements relating to the costs associated with implementing our TSO program, our plans to invest in our business, our expected stock-based compensation charges, the expected dilution related to equity grants to our employees, our anticipated effective tax rate for 2007, and our plans to make significant capital expenditures. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, risks related to our hiring patterns, the amount of stock-based compensation we issue to our service providers, the uncertain and complex nature of tax forecasting, the fact that we may have exposure to greater than expected tax liabilities, and our need to expend capital to accommodate the growth of the business, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions "Risk Factors" and
 
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in our report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2006, which is on file with the SEC and is available on our investor relations website at investor.google.com and on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, which will be filed with the SEC in March 2007. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of January 31, 2007, and Google undertakes no duty to update this information.
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, non-GAAP effective tax rate, and free cash flow. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures," "Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP effective tax rate for discrete tax items" and "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow" included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our "recurring core business operating results," meaning our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature, such as gains from the sale of investments and the related tax effects of such non-cash charges. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income minus stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenues. Google considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and
Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin.
 
investors because they exclude the effect of stock-based compensation so that Google's management and investors can compare Google's recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. We believe that, given our recent adoption of FAS 123R, it is difficult for investors to evaluate our GAAP results of operations on a year-over-year basis because our GAAP results of operations for 2005 calculated our stock-based compensation expense in a different manner than that required under FAS 123R. Therefore, investors cannot compare the year-over-year results of our recurring core business operating results unless we exclude these non-cash charges that result from two different accounting methods. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use when adopting FAS 123R, Google's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between Google's recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing Google's management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Google's own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, non-GAAP operating income excludes some costs, namely, stock-based compensation, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Google's business. Second, stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Third, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP.
We define non-GAAP net income as net income plus stock-based compensation, less the related tax effects minus certain discrete benefits to our provision for income taxes. We define non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average shares, on a fully-diluted basis, outstanding as of December 31, 2006. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that Google uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results, we exclude from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS the tax effects associated with stock-based compensation, as well as certain discrete benefits to our provision for income taxes. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results. The same limitations described above regarding Google's use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS together with net income and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP net income and EPS.
 
Non-GAAP effective tax rates
We define the non-GAAP effective tax rates as income before income taxes divided into the sum obtained by adding certain discrete items to our provision for income taxes. These discrete items included amounts we were able to deduct from our provision for income taxes as a result of releasing certain reserves upon our entering into an advance pricing agreement with the IRS and the enactment of the 2006 R&D tax credit in the fourth quarter of 2006. We consider this non-GAAP financial measure to be a useful metric for management and investors because it excludes the effect of certain discrete items so that Google's management and investors can compare Google's recurring earnings results over multiple periods. The same limitations described above regarding Google's use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of the non-GAAP effective tax rates. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from the non-GAAP effective tax rates and evaluating the non-GAAP effective tax rates together with the effective tax rates computed on a GAAP basis.
. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period since it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement and under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in its Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Free cash flow
Google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.

On March 16, 2007, Michael Moritz informed the Company that he will not stand for re-election to the Board of Directors of the Company at the end of his current term.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  March 22, 2007  Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) today announced that Michael Moritz has informed the company that he will not seek re-election to its board of directors at the 2007 stockholder meeting. Moritz, who has been a director since May 1999, said his decision will allow him to focus more time on his responsibilities as a general partner of Sequoia Capital.
"Mike's many contributions to Google over the years as investor and director helped us immensely," said Eric Schmidt, Google's chief executive officer. "His insights, drive, and determination are part of Google today and will be so forever."
"Larry and I both have valued Mike's counsel and wisdom from Google's earliest days," added Sergey Brin, Google's co-founder and president of technology. "We respect his decision to focus more of his energies on Sequoia, but will miss him. Sequoia provided crucial advice, funding and leadership to Google and we look forward to working with the entire set of distinguished partners at Sequoia in the future."
"Larry and Sergey's originality and the remarkable accomplishments of Eric and the Google management have generated substantial returns for Sequoia Capital's limited partners - almost all of which are charities," said Moritz. "I'm delighted to have played a role in these achievements and, along with my partners at Sequoia, look forward to identifying and supporting new businesses, in partnership with Google and others."
Google will hold its annual election of directors at its stockholder meeting on May 10, 2007.

Executive Bonus Plan
On March 22, 2007, the Board of Directors of Google Inc. (the "Board") approved an Executive Bonus Plan (the "Plan"), effective as of January 1, 2007, subject to stockholder approval at Google's 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Plan is a variable cash incentive program designed to motivate participants to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve Google's financial and other performance objectives. In addition, the Plan is intended to permit the payment of bonuses that qualify as performance-based compensation under section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Committee") selects the employees of Google who will be eligible to earn awards under the Plan. The actual number of employees who will be eligible to receive an award during any particular year cannot be determined in advance because the Committee has discretion to select the participants.
Under the Plan, participants will be eligible to receive an award only if and to the extent performance goals predetermined by the Committee are achieved. At the beginning of each performance period, which generally will last from one to three fiscal years, the Committee will assign each participant a maximum award and performance goal or goals that must be achieved before bonus amounts will actually be paid to the participant. The participant's maximum award typically will be expressed as a multiple of his or her base salary earned during the applicable performance period.
The performance goals will require the achievement of objectives for one or more of (a) cash position, (b) controllable profits, (c) customer satisfaction MBOs, (d) earnings per chare, (e) EBITDA, (f) free cash flow, (g) net income, (h) new orders, (i) operating cash flow, (j) operating income, (k) return on assets, (l) return on equity, (m) return on sales, (n) revenue, and (o) total shareholder return. Each of these measures is defined in the Plan. Performance goals may differ from participant to participant, from performance period to performance period and from award to award.
The Committee administers the Plan. Members of the Committee must qualify as "outside directors" under Section 162(m). Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee has all discretion and authority necessary or appropriate to control and manage the operation and administration of the Plan. In no event may any participant's award for any performance period exceed $6 million. The Committee or the Board generally may amend or terminate the Plan at any time and for any reason.
Fiscal Year 2007 Executive Bonus Awards
For fiscal year 2007, the Committee determined that all of Google's executive officers, other than Eric Schmidt, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, would be participants in the Plan. The Committee set the maximum amount payable to any one executive in the fiscal year 2007 at $4.5 million. The actual bonus paid to individual executives will be based on a formula tied to Google's non-GAAP operating income. The Committee retains discretion to reduce or eliminate (but not increase) the bonus that would otherwise be payable.
The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Plan, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.23 and incorporated herein by reference.

However, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may declare any Actual Award, in whole or in part, payable in restricted stock or restricted stock units granted under the Company's 2004 Stock Plan, or any such other shareholder approved equity compensation plan. The number of Shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units granted shall be determined by dividing the cash amount foregone by the fair market value of a Share on the date that the cash payment otherwise would have been made, rounded up to the nearest whole number of Shares. For this purpose, "fair market value" shall mean the closing price on the Nasdaq Global Select Market for the day in question. Any restricted stock or restricted stock unit so awarded shall be either (a) vested immediately or (b) be subject to such additional vesting over a period of not more than four years, and/or be subject to additional vesting conditions, including specifically additional Performance Goals, as determined by the Committee in its discretion. The number of Shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units granted pursuant to this Section 4.3 may be increased or decreased if such new award is granted by the Committee subject to Performance Goals and such increase or decrease otherwise meets the performance-based compensation requirements of section 162(m) of the Code.
Form of Payment
4.4 . If a Participant dies, or is determined to have a Disability, prior to the payment of an Actual Award that was scheduled to be paid to him or her prior to death, or the determination of a Disability, for a prior Performance Period, the Award shall be paid, in the case of death, to his or her estate, and in the case of Disability, to the Participant or any other person authorized under applicable law.
Payment in the Event of Death or Disability
 
5.1 . The Plan shall be administered by the Committee. The Committee shall consist of not less than two (2) members of the Board. The members of the Committee shall be appointed from time to time by, and serve at the pleasure of, the Board. Each member of the Committee shall qualify as an "outside director" under section 162(m) of the Code. If it is later determined that one or more members of the Committee do not so qualify, actions taken by the Committee prior to such determination shall be valid despite such failure to qualify. As of the Effective Date of the Plan, the Plan shall be administered by the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee of the Board.
Committee is the Administrator

Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On April 13, 2007, Google Inc. ("Google" or the "Company"), a Delaware corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Google ("Sub"), and Click Holding Corp. ("DoubleClick"), a Delaware corporation, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"). Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Google will acquire DoubleClick by means of a merger of DoubleClick with and into Sub (the "Merger"), with DoubleClick continuing as the surviving corporation after the Merger.
At the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of the capital stock of DoubleClick, each share of DoubleClick common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into an amount in cash equal to the "Calculation Amount" divided by the total number of outstanding shares of DoubleClick common stock plus the total number of shares underlying outstanding options and stock appreciation rights for DoubleClick common stock (such quotient, the "Per Share Amount"). The "Calculation Amount" under the Merger Agreement is equal to $3.11 billion plus the cash and cash equivalents of DoubleClick and its subsidiaries plus the aggregate exercise price for outstanding options and stock appreciation rights for DoubleClick common stock minus unpaid third party expenses incurred by DoubleClick in connection with the Merger and minus all indebtedness for borrowed money of DoubleClick, in each case, as of the Effective Time.
At the Effective Time, each vested option and stock appreciation right for DoubleClick common stock will be cancelled in exchange for a cash payment equal to the number of shares of DoubleClick common stock underlying such option or stock appreciation right multiplied by the excess, if any, of the Per Share Amount over the strike price for such option or stock appreciation right. At the Effective Time, unvested options and stock appreciation rights will be converted into options to purchase Google Class A common stock with economic terms based upon the Per Share Amount in accordance with the Merger Agreement.
The completion of the Merger is subject to various customary conditions, including termination or expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and receipt of certain foreign antitrust approvals and clearances. Google and DoubleClick have each agreed to take all actions necessary to obtain the requisite antitrust and other regulatory approvals, as further described in the Merger Agreement.
The Boards of Directors of Google and DoubleClick have each approved the Merger and the Merger Agreement. Subsequent to the execution of the Merger Agreement, holders of DoubleClick common stock acting by written consent adopted the Merger Agreement. No further vote of DoubleClick stockholders is required to consummate the Merger and no vote of Google stockholders is required to consummate the Merger.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is attached to this Report as Exhibit 2.1 and incorporated herein by reference. The Merger Agreement has been attached to provide investors with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about Google or DoubleClick. In particular, the assertions embodied in the representations and warranties made by DoubleClick in the Merger Agreement are qualified by information in confidential disclosure schedules provided by DoubleClick to Google in connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement. These disclosure schedules contain information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties set forth in the Merger Agreement. Moreover, certain representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement were used for the purpose of allocating risk between Google and DoubleClick rather than establishing matters as facts. Accordingly, you should not rely on the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement as characterizations of the actual state of facts about Google or DoubleClick.
Item 8.01. Other Events.
On April 13, 2007, Google issued a press release announcing that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire DoubleClick.
The full text of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

"Combining DoubleClick's cutting edge digital solutions for both media buyers and sellers with Google's scale and innovative resources will bring tremendous value to both our employees and clients."
"When we acquired DoubleClick in July 2005, we saw an opportunity to partner with a great management team to further enhance the company's capabilities and growth trajectory," said Philip Hammarskjold, Managing Director of Hellman & Friedman. "This transaction affirms the successful transformation of DoubleClick, positions the firm for the future, and greatly benefits our investors."
Both companies have approved the transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions, and is expected to close by the end of the year.

Q1 Financial Highlights
Google reported revenues of $3.66 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, representing a 63% increase over first quarter 2006 revenues of $2.25 billion and a 14% increase over fourth quarter 2006 revenues of $3.21 billion. Google reports its revenues, consistent with GAAP, on a gross basis without deducting traffic acquisition costs, or TAC.
Revenues 
 Google-owned sites generated revenues of $2.28 billion, or 62% of total revenues, in the first quarter of 2007. This represents a 76% increase over first quarter 2006 revenues of $1.30 billion and a 15% increase over fourth quarter 2006 revenues of $1.98 billion.
Google Sites Revenues
 Google's partner sites generated revenues, through AdSense programs, of $1.35 billion, or 37% of total revenues, in the first quarter of 2007. This represents a 45% increase over network revenues of $928 million generated in the first quarter of 2006 and a 12% increase over fourth quarter 2006 revenues of $1.20 billion.
Google Network Revenues
 Revenues from outside of the United States totaled $1.71 billion, representing 47% of total revenues in the first quarter of 2007, compared to 42% in the first quarter of 2006 and 44% in the fourth quarter of 2006. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant from the fourth quarter of 2006 through the first quarter of 2007, our revenues in the first quarter of 2007 would have been $23 million lower. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant from the first quarter of 2006 through the first quarter of 2007, our revenues in the first quarter of 2007 would have been $115 million lower.
International Revenues
Revenues from the United Kingdom totaled $578 million, representing 16% of revenue in the first quarter of 2007, compared to 15% in the first quarter of 2006 and 15% in the fourth quarter of 2006.
 Aggregate paid clicks, which include clicks related to ads served on Google sites and our AdSense partners, increased approximately 52% over the first quarter of 2006 and approximately 13% over the fourth quarter of 2006.
Paid Clicks
, the portion of revenues shared with Google's partners, increased to $1.13 billion in the first quarter of 2007. This compares to TAC of $976 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. TAC as a percentage of advertising revenues was 31% in the first quarter of 2007 and the fourth quarter of 2006.
TAC  Traffic Acquisition Costs
 
The majority of TAC expense is related to amounts ultimately paid to our AdSense partners, which totaled $1.05 billion in the first quarter of 2007. TAC is also related to amounts ultimately paid to certain distribution partners and others who direct traffic to our website, which totaled $73 million in the first quarter of 2007.
Other cost of revenues, which is comprised primarily of data center operational expenses, as well as credit card processing charges, increased to $345 million, or 9% of revenues, in the first quarter of 2007, compared to $307 million, or 10% of revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2006.
Other Cost of Revenues 
Operating expenses, other than cost of revenues, were $972 million in the first quarter of 2007, compared to $862 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. These operating expenses included $506 million in payroll-related and facilities expenses, compared to $493 million in the fourth quarter of 2006.
Operating Expenses 
 In the first quarter of 2007, the total charge related to stock-based compensation was $184 million as compared to $134 million in the fourth quarter of 2006.
Stock-Based Compensation
We anticipate that we will launch our employee transferable stock options (TSO) program in the second quarter. We expect to incur a modification charge for SBC in accordance with GAAP of approximately $90 million in the second quarter related to vested options as of the end of the quarter and a charge of approximately $170 million over their remaining vesting periods of up to approximately four years related to unvested options. The market value of our stock used to compute the above forecasted modification charges was $476 per share. Also, as a result of allowing eligible options to be transferred in the TSO program, the fair value of each TSO granted in the future will be greater than it otherwise would be, resulting in more stock-based compensation per option.
Before these incremental charges related to the TSO program, we currently estimate stock-based compensation charges for grants to employees prior to April 1, 2007 to be approximately $639 million for 2007. This does not include expenses to be recognized related to employee stock awards that are granted after April 1, 2007 or non-employee stock awards that have been or may be granted. We currently anticipate that dilution related to all equity grants to employees will be at or below 2% this year.
GAAP operating income in the first quarter of 2007 was $1.22 billion, or 33% of revenues. This compares to GAAP operating income of $1.06 billion, or 33% of revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2006. Non-GAAP operating income in the first quarter of 2007 was $1.41 billion, or 38% of revenues. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $1.20 billion, or 37% of revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2006.
Operating Income 
 
 GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2007 was $1.0 billion as compared to $1.03 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006. Non-GAAP net income was $1.16 billion in the first quarter of 2007, compared to $997 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. GAAP EPS for the first quarter of 2007 was $3.18 on 315 million diluted shares outstanding, compared to $3.29 for the fourth quarter of 2006, on 313 million diluted shares outstanding. Non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter of 2007 was $3.68, compared to $3.18 in the fourth quarter of 2006.
Net Income
 Our effective tax rate was 26% for the first quarter of 2007.
Income Taxes
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the first quarter of 2007 totaled $1.22 billion as compared to $911 million for the fourth quarter of 2006. In the first quarter of 2007, capital expenditures were $597 million, the majority of which was related to IT infrastructure investments, including data centers, servers, and networking equipment. Free cash flow, an alternative non-GAAP measure of liquidity, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. In the first quarter of 2007, free cash flow was $623 million.
Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures
In 2007, we expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures.
A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, the GAAP measure of liquidity, is included at the end of this release.
 As of March 31, 2007, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $11.9 billion.
Cash
On a worldwide basis, Google employed 12,238 full-time employees as of March 31, 2007, up from 10,674 full time employees as of December 31, 2006.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements relating to the expenses associated with implementing our TSO program, our plans to invest in our business, our expected stock-based compensation charges, the expected dilution related to equity grants to our employees, and our plans to make significant capital expenditures. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, risks related to our hiring patterns, the amount of stock-based compensation we issue to our service providers, the uncertain and complex nature of tax forecasting, the fact that we may have exposure to greater than expected tax liabilities, our need to expend capital to accommodate the growth of the business, the extent to which the number of options outstanding at the time we launch the TSO program is different than our expectations, and the extent to which the variables used to revalue TSOs at the time we launch the TSO program, including the market value and volatility of our stock, are different than our expectations, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006, which is on file with the SEC and is available on our investor relations website at investor.google.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, which will be filed with the SEC in May 2007. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of April 19, 2007, and Google undertakes no duty to update this information.
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures" and "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow" included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our "recurring core business operating results," meaning our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We
 
believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income minus stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenues. Google considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of stock-based compensation so that Google's management and investors can compare Google's recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under FAS 123R, Google's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between Google's recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing Google's management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Google's own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, non-GAAP operating income excludes some costs, namely, stock-based compensation, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Google's business. Second, stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Third, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin.
We define non-GAAP net income as net income plus stock-based compensation, less the related tax effects. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2006, we subtracted discrete tax items consisting of amounts we were able to deduct from our provision for income taxes as a result of releasing certain reserves upon our entering into an advanced pricing agreement with the IRS and the enactment of the 2006 R&D tax credit in the fourth quarter of 2006. We define non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average shares, on a fully-diluted basis, outstanding as of March 31, 2007. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that Google uses non-GAAP
Non-GAAP net income and EPS.
 
operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results, we exclude from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS the tax effects associated with stock-based compensation. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2006, we excluded the discrete benefits to our provision for income taxes discussed above. The same limitations described above regarding Google's use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS together with net income and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP.
. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period since it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement and under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Form 10-Q.
Free cash flow
Google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
The accompanying tables have more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.

Additional Agreements of the Company
7. . (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each of you and each person, if any, who controls each of you within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act and each of your affiliates within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim) caused by any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any amendment thereof, any Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus as defined in Rule 433(h) under the Securities Act, any Company information that the Company has filed, or is required to file, pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or the Hedging Prospectus (each as amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or supplements thereto), or caused by any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities are caused by any such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based upon information relating to the relevant Bidder furnished to the Company in writing by such Bidder expressly for use therein.
Indemnification and Contribution
(b) Each of you agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each of you, but only with reference to
 
information relating to the relevant Bidder furnished to the Company in writing by such Bidder expressly for use in the Registration Statement, any Time of Sale Prospectus, any issuer free writing prospectus or the Hedging Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto.
(c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 7(a) or 7(b), such person (the "") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the "") in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. Such firm shall be designated in writing by the indemnified party, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(a), and by the Company, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 7(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
indemnified party
indemnifying party
 
(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in Section 7(a) or 7(b) is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein in connection with any short sale of Shares effected using the Hedging Prospectus, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the relevant Bidder on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the relevant Bidder on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by such Bidder and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The obligations of the Bidders to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the respective aggregate notional amounts of Transferable Stock Options purchased by each Bidder under the Transferable Stock Option Program, and not joint.
(e) The Company and each of you agrees that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 7(d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in Section 7(d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Bidder shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which such Bidder sold Shares to the public using the Hedging Prospectus exceeds the amount of any damages that such Bidder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.
pro rata
(f) The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 7 and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement or the Program Agreements will remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of (i) any termination of this Agreement or any Program Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of the relevant Bidder, any person controlling such Bidder or any of its affiliates or by or on behalf of the Company, its officers or directors or any person controlling the Company and (iii) acceptance of and payment for any of the Warrants purchased under the Transferable Stock Option Program.
 
8. . The Company may terminate this Agreement in whole or as to any Bidder and any Bidder may terminate this Agreement as to such Bidder, in each case, at any time by giving written notice of such termination to the other parties hereto not less than three Exchange Business Days prior to the effective date of such notice. Any such termination shall be without prejudice to any rights, obligations or liabilities of the parties hereto accrued or incurred prior to such termination. If this Agreement is terminated, the last paragraph of Section 5 and Sections 3(d), 4(e), 4(j), 7, 10, and 12 shall survive as to the Company and each terminated Bidder.

If such Warrantholder is satisfied with such procedures and documentation, it shall sell the Restricted Shares pursuant to such registration statement during a period (the "") commencing on the Registration Deadline and ending on the earliest of (x) the Exchange Business Day on which the Warrantholder completes the sale of all Restricted Shares or, in the case of settlement of Warrant Termination Delivery Units, a sufficient number of Restricted Shares so that the realized net proceeds of such sales exceed the Payment Obligation, (y) the date upon which all Restricted Shares have been sold or transferred pursuant to Rule 144 (or similar provisions then in force) or Rule 145(d)(1) or (2) (or any similar provision then in force) under the Securities Act and (iii) the date upon which all Restricted Shares may be sold or transferred by a non-affiliate pursuant to Rule 144(k) (or any similar provision then in force) or Rule 145(d)(3) (or any similar provision then in force) under the Securities Act.

If the Issuer does not so elect, then failure to effect such Private Placement Settlement or such Registration Settlement shall constitute an event for which the relevant Warrantholder shall determine a Cancellation Amount. Any such Cancellation Amount shall be payable in cash by the Issuer to the relevant Warrantholder or Bidder, as the case may be, pursuant to Section 6.06 and Section 6.07.

If the Issuer determines that a Change in Accounting has occurred, the Issuer may elect to terminate the Warrants upon at least [10] Scheduled Trading Days' notice to the Warrant Agent and the Warrantholders, specifying the date of such termination, in which event the Warrants shall be terminated on such date (or if such date is not an Exchange Business Day, on the immediately succeeding Exchange Business Day), and the relevant Warrantholders shall determine the Cancellation Amount; that such election shall have no force or effect unless the Issuer certifies to the relevant Warrantholders in such notice that, as of the date of such notice, (A) the Issuer is not aware of any material nonpublic information regarding the Issuer or the Shares and (B) all reports and other documents filed by the Issuer with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act when considered as a whole (with the more recent such reports and documents deemed to amend inconsistent statements contained in any earlier such reports and documents), do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or any omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.

If the Lending Party does not lend Shares in the amount of the Hedging Shares or a satisfactory Lending Party is not identified within this period, the Warrantholder may give notice to the Issuer that it elects to terminate the relevant Warrants, specifying the date of such termination, which may be the same day that the notice of termination is effective, in which event such

(b) In determining a Cancellation Amount, the affected Warrantholder may consider any relevant information, including, without limitation, one or more of the following types of information:
(i) quotations (either firm or indicative) for replacement transactions supplied by one or more third parties that may take into account the current creditworthiness of such Warrantholder at the time the quotation is provided and the terms of any relevant documentation, including credit support documentation, between such Warrantholder and the third party providing the quotation; or

Third parties supplying quotations pursuant to Section 6.07(b)(i) above or market data pursuant to Section 6.07(b)(ii) above may include, without limitation, dealers in the relevant markets, end-users of the relevant product, information vendors, brokers and other sources of market information.
(d) Without duplication of amounts calculated based on information described in Section 6.07(b)(i) or Section 6.07(b)(ii) above, or other relevant information, and when it is commercially reasonable to do so, the affected Warrantholder may in addition consider in calculating a Cancellation Amount any loss or cost incurred in connection with such Warrantholder's terminating, liquidating or re-establishing any hedge related to such Warrant (or any gain resulting from any of them) but only to the extent that the sum of any such losses or costs does not exceed the amount that otherwise would have been incurred in connection with terminating, liquidating or re-establishing such hedge, assuming that such hedge had been established and maintained in a commercially reasonable manner.
(e) Commercially reasonable procedures used in determining a Cancellation Amount may include the following:
(i) application to relevant market data from third parties pursuant to Section 6.07(b)(ii) above of pricing or other valuation models that are, at the time of the determination of the Cancellation Amount, used by the affected Warrantholder in the regular course of its business in pricing or valuing transactions between such Warrantholder and unrelated third parties that are similar to the relevant Warrant or Transferable Stock Option; and
(ii) application of different valuation methods to the relevant Warrant or Transferable Stock Option depending on the type, complexity or size of the relevant Warrant or Transferable Stock Option.

The Issuer shall not take any action to decrease the number of Available Shares below the Capped Number and shall notify the Warrant Agent and the Warrantholders if the full number of Shares issuable upon the exercise of all outstanding Warrants (assuming that all such Warrants are subject to Full Physical Settlement) exceeds 75% of the Capped Number.

In granting Restricted Stock Units, Restricted Stock, Performance Shares or Performance Units which are intended to qualify under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator shall follow any procedures determined by it from time to time to be necessary or appropriate to ensure qualification of the Award under Section 162(m) of the Code (e.g., in determining the Performance Goals).
Section 162(m) Performance Restrictions
(iv) The foregoing limitations will be adjusted proportionately in connection with any change in the Company's capitalization as described in Section 15 of the Plan.
(v) If an Award is cancelled in the same Fiscal Year in which it was granted (other than in connection with a transaction described in Section 15 of the Plan), the cancelled Award will be counted against the limits set forth in subsections (i) and (ii) above. For this purpose, if the exercise price of an Option is reduced, the transaction will be treated as a cancellation of the Option and the grant of a new Option.
7. .
Stock Options
(a) . The term of each Option will be stated in the Award Agreement. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the term will be ten (10) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement. Moreover, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Participant who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Incentive Stock Option will be five (5) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement.
Term of Option
(b) .
Option Exercise Price and Consideration
(i) . The per Share exercise price for the Shares to be issued pursuant to exercise of an Option will be determined by the Administrator, subject to the following:
Exercise Price
(1) In the case of an Incentive Stock Option
(A) granted to an Employee who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price will be no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
(B) granted to any Employee other than an Employee described in paragraph (A) immediately above, the per Share exercise price will be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
(2) In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option, the per Share exercise price will be determined by the Administrator. In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the per Share exercise price will be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Incentive Stock Options may be granted with a per Share exercise price of less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant pursuant to a merger or other corporate transaction.
(ii) . At the time an Option is granted, the Administrator will fix the period within which the Option may be exercised and will determine any conditions that must be satisfied before the Option may be exercised.
Waiting Period and Exercise Dates
(c) . The Administrator will determine the acceptable form of consideration for exercising an Option, including the method of payment. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the Administrator will determine the acceptable form of consideration at the time of grant. Such consideration to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws may consist entirely of:
Form of Consideration
(i) cash;
(ii) check;
(iii) promissory note;
(iv) other Shares which meet the conditions established by the Administrator to avoid adverse accounting consequences (as determined by the Administrator);
(v) consideration received by the Company under a cashless exercise program implemented by the Company in connection with the Plan;
(vi) a reduction in the amount of any Company liability to the Participant, including any liability attributable to the Participant's participation in any Company-sponsored deferred compensation program or arrangement;
(vii) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment; or
(viii) such other consideration and method of payment for the issuance of Shares to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.
(d) .
Exercise of Option
(i) . Any Option granted hereunder will be exercisable according to the terms of the Plan and at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Administrator and set forth in the Award Agreement. An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.
Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Stockholder
An Option will be deemed exercised when the Company receives: (x) written or electronic notice of exercise (in accordance with the Award Agreement) from the person entitled to exercise the Option, and (y) full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised. Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Award Agreement and the Plan. Shares issued upon exercise of an Option will be issued in the name of the Participant or, if requested by the Participant, in the name of the Participant and his or her spouse. Until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder will exist with respect to the Awarded Stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company will issue (or cause to be issued) such Shares promptly after the Option is exercised. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the Shares are issued, except as provided in Section 15 of the Plan or the applicable Award Agreement.
Exercising an Option in any manner will decrease the number of Shares thereafter available for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.
(ii) . If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider, other than upon the Participant's death or Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for three (3) months following the Participant's termination. Unless otherwise
Termination of Relationship as a Service Provider
provided by the Administrator, if on the date of termination the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will revert to the Plan on the date one (1) month following the Participant's termination. If after termination the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified by the Administrator, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.
(iii) . If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider as a result of the Participant's Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following the Participant's termination. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if on the date of termination the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will revert to the Plan on the date one (1) month following the Participant's termination. If after termination the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.
Disability of Participant
(iv) . If a Participant dies while a Service Provider, the Option may be exercised following the Participant's death within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of death (but in no event may the option be exercised later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement), by the Participant's designated beneficiary, provided such beneficiary has been designated prior to Participant's death in a form acceptable to the Administrator. If no such beneficiary has been designated by the Participant, then such Option may be exercised by the personal representative of the Participant's estate or by the person(s) to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to the Participant's will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution. In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following Participant's death. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if at the time of death Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will immediately revert to the Plan on the date one (1) month following the Participant's death. If the Option is not so exercised within the time specified herein, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.
Death of Participant
(e) . The Administrator may at any time offer to buy out for a payment in cash or Shares an Option previously granted based on such terms and conditions as the Administrator shall establish and communicate to the Participant at the time that such offer is made.
Buyout Provisions
8. .

Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Administrator, at any time and from time to time, may grant Shares of Restricted Stock to Service Providers in such amounts as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine.

Removal of Restrictions
(f) . During the Period of Restriction, Service Providers holding Shares of Restricted Stock granted hereunder may exercise full voting rights with respect to those Shares, unless the Administrator determines otherwise.
Voting Rights
(g) . During the Period of Restriction, Service Providers holding Shares of Restricted Stock will be entitled to receive all dividends and other distributions paid with respect to such Shares unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement. If any such dividends or distributions are paid in Shares, the Shares will be subject to the same restrictions on transferability and forfeitability as the Shares of Restricted Stock with respect to which they were paid.

Expiration of SARs
(g) . Upon exercise of an SAR, a Participant will be entitled to receive payment from the Company in an amount determined by multiplying:
Payment of SAR Amount
(i) The difference between the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise over the exercise price; times
(ii) The number of Shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised.
At the discretion of the Administrator, the payment upon SAR exercise may be in cash, in Shares of equivalent value, or in some combination thereof.
(h) . The Administrator may at any time offer to buy out for a payment in cash or Shares a Stock Appreciation Right previously granted based on such terms and conditions as the Administrator shall establish and communicate to the Participant at the time that such offer is made.
Buyout Provisions
10. .
Performance Units and Performance Shares
(a) . Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, Performance Units and Performance Shares may be granted to Service Providers at any time and from time to time, as will be determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion. Subject to Section 6(c)(ii), the Administrator will have complete discretion in determining the number of Performance Units and Performance Shares granted to each Participant.
Grant of Performance Units/Shares
(b) . Each Performance Unit will have an initial value that is established by the Administrator on or before the date of grant. Each Performance Share will have an initial value equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant.
Value of Performance Units/Shares
(c) . The Administrator will set performance objectives in its discretion which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the number or value of Performance Units/Shares that will be paid out to the Service Providers. The time period during which the performance objectives must be met will be called the "Performance Period." Each Award of Performance Units/ Shares will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the Performance Period, and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine. The Administrator may set performance objectives based upon the achievement of Company-wide, divisional, or individual goals, applicable federal or state securities laws, or any other basis determined by the Administrator in its discretion.
Performance Objectives and Other Terms
(d) . After the applicable Performance Period has ended, the holder of Performance Units/Shares will be entitled to receive a payout of the number of Performance Units/Shares earned by the Participant over the Performance Period, to be determined as a function of the extent to which the corresponding performance objectives have been achieved. After the grant of a Performance Unit/Share, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any performance objectives for such Performance Unit/Share.
Earning of Performance Units/Shares
(e) . Payment of earned Performance Units/Shares will be made as soon after the expiration of the applicable Performance Period at the time determined by the Administrator.

Other Stock Based Awards
13. . Unless the Administrator provides otherwise, vesting of Awards granted hereunder will be suspended during any unpaid leave of absence and will resume on the date the Participant returns to work on a regular schedule as determined by the Company; provided, however, that no vesting credit will be awarded for the time vesting has been suspended during such leave of absence. A Service Provider will not cease to be an Employee in the case of (i) any leave of absence approved by the Company or (ii) transfers between locations of the Company or between the Company, its Parent, or any Subsidiary.
Leaves of Absence

Notwithstanding the preceding, the number of Shares subject to any Award always shall be a whole number.
Adjustments
(b) . In the event that any dividend (excluding an ordinary dividend) or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities, or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Shares occurs then the Administrator shall appropriately adjust the number and class of Shares which may be delivered under the Plan, the 162(m) annual share issuance limits under Section 6(c) of the Plan, and the number, class, and price of Shares subject to outstanding Awards. Notwithstanding the preceding, the number of Shares subject to any Award always shall be a whole number.
Dissolution or Liquidation
(c) .
Merger or Change in Control
(i) . In the event of a merger or Change in Control, each outstanding Option and SAR shall be assumed or an equivalent option or SAR substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. With respect to Options and SARs granted to an Outside Director that are assumed or substituted for, if immediately prior to or after the merger or Change in Control the Participant's status as a Director or a director of the successor corporation, as applicable, is terminated other than upon a voluntary resignation by the Participant, then the Participant shall fully vest in and have the right to exercise such Options and SARs as to all of the Awarded Stock, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested or exercisable. Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, in the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Option or SAR, the Participant shall fully vest in and have the right to exercise the Option or SAR as to all of the Awarded Stock, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested or exercisable. If an Option or SAR is not assumed or substituted in the event of a merger or Change in Control, the Administrator shall notify the Participant in writing or electronically that the Option or SAR shall be exercisable, to the extent vested, for a period of up to fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, and the Option or SAR shall terminate upon the expiration of such period. For the purposes of this paragraph, the Option or SAR shall be considered assumed if, following the merger or Change in Control, the option or stock appreciation right confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share of Awarded Stock subject to the Option or SAR immediately prior to the merger or Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the merger or Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding
Stock Options and SARS
Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the merger or Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of the Option or SAR, for each Share of Awarded Stock subject to the Option or SAR, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or Change in Control. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more performance goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such performance goals without the Participant's consent; provided, however, a modification to such performance goals only to reflect the successor corporation's post-merger or post-Change in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.
(ii) . In the event of a merger or Change in Control, each outstanding Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award and Restricted Stock Unit awards shall be assumed or an equivalent Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award and Restricted Stock Unit award substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. With respect to Awards granted to an Outside Director that are assumed or substituted for, if immediately prior to or after the merger or Change in Control the Participant's status as a Director or a director of the successor corporation, as applicable, is terminated other than upon a voluntary resignation by the Participant, then the Participant shall fully vest in such Awards, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested. Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, in the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award or Restricted Stock Unit award, the Participant shall fully vest in the Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award or Restricted Stock Unit including as to Shares which would not otherwise be vested. For the purposes of this paragraph, a Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award and Restricted Stock Unit award shall be considered assumed if, following the merger or Change in Control, the award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Award immediately prior to the merger or Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the merger or Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the merger or Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received, for each Share and each unit/right to acquire a Share subject to the Award, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or Change in Control. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more performance goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such performance goals without the Participant's consent; provided, however, a modification to such performance goals only to reflect the successor corporation's post-merger or post-Change in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.
Restricted Stock, Performance Shares, Performance Units, Restricted Stock Units and Other Stock Based Awards
16. . The date of grant of an Award will be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the determination granting such Award, or such other later date as is determined by the Administrator. Notice of the determination will be provided to each Participant within a reasonable time after the date of such grant.
Date of Grant
17. . Subject to Section 22 of the Plan, the Plan will become effective upon its adoption by the Board. It will continue in effect for a term of ten (10) years unless terminated earlier under Section 18 of the Plan.
Term of Plan
18. .
Amendment and Termination of the Plan
(a) . The Board may at any time amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan.
Amendment and Termination
(b) . The Company will obtain stockholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with Applicable Laws.
Stockholder Approval
(c) . Subject to Section 20 of the Plan, no amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan will impair the rights of any Participant, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Participant and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Participant and the Company. Termination of the Plan will not affect the Administrator's ability to exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to Awards granted under the Plan prior to the date of such termination.
Effect of Amendment or Termination
19. .
Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares
(a) . Shares will not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Award unless the exercise of such Award and the issuance and delivery of such Shares will comply with Applicable Laws and will be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
Legal Compliance
(b) . As a condition to the exercise or receipt of an Award, the Company may require the person exercising or receiving such Award to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise or receipt that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required.
Investment Representations
20. . Notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Plan or an Award to the contrary, if any one or more of the provisions (or any part thereof) of this Plan or the Awards shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such provision shall be modified so as to make it valid, legal and enforceable, and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions (or any part thereof) of the Plan or Award, as applicable, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
Severability
21. . The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, will relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority will not have been obtained.
Inability to Obtain Authority
22. . The Plan will be subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date the Plan is adopted. Such stockholder approval will be obtained in the manner and to the degree required under Applicable Laws.
Stockholder Approval

In May 2007, Google Inc. invested approximately $3.9 million in the Series A preferred stock financing of 23andMe, Inc., an early stage biotech company focused on helping consumers understand and browse their genome. Google now holds a minority interest in 23andMe as a result of this investment. 23andMe's Series A financing involved a number of additional investors including New Enterprise Associates, Mohr Davidow Ventures and Genentech, Inc. Anne Wojcicki, who is a co-founder of 23andMe and who is also a shareholder and member of the board of directors, is married to Sergey Brin, Google's President, Technology and one of its founders. Sergey also holds approximately 35% of Google's Class B common stock. Prior to Google's investment in 23andMe, Sergey provided approximately $2.6 million in interim debt financing to 23andMe, which was repaid as part of this financing transaction. Genentech's Chief Executive Officer, Arthur Levinson, is also a member of the board of directors of Google. Google's Audit Committee reviewed and approved this transaction as part of Google's procedures for entering into transactions with related parties. As part of its decision-making process, the Audit Committee was advised by independent counsel and received and considered a report from an independent advisor as to the valuation of 23andMe.

Google reports its revenues, consistent with GAAP, on a gross basis without deducting TAC.
Revenues
Google-owned sites generated revenues of $2.49 billion, or 64% of total revenues, in the second quarter of 2007. This represents a 74% increase over second quarter 2006 revenues of $1.43 billion and a 9% increase over first quarter 2007 revenues of $2.28 billion.

We currently estimate stock-based compensation charges for grants to employees prior to July 1, 2007 to be approximately $770 million for 2007. This does not include expenses to be recognized related to employee stock awards that are granted after July 1, 2007 or non-employee stock awards that have been or may be granted. We currently anticipate that dilution related to all equity grants to employees will be at or below 2% this year.
GAAP operating income in the second quarter of 2007 was $1.10 billion, or 29% of revenues. This compares to GAAP operating income of $1.22 billion, or 33% of revenues, in the first quarter of 2007. Non-GAAP operating income in the second quarter of 2007 was $1.35 billion, or 35% of revenues.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements relating to the expenses associated with implementing our TSO program, our expected stock-based compensation charges, the expected dilution related to equity grants to our employees, and our plans to make significant capital expenditures. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, risks related to our hiring patterns, the amount of stock-based compensation we issue to our service providers, our need to expend capital to accommodate the growth of the business, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, which is on file with the SEC and is available on our investor relations website at investor.google.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2007, which will be filed with the SEC in August 2007. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of July 19, 2007, and Google undertakes no duty to update this information.
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, and free cash flow. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures" and "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow" included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our "recurring core business operating results," meaning our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
. We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income plus stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenues. Google considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of stock-based compensation so that Google's management and investors can compare Google's recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under FAS 123R, Google's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between Google's recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing Google's management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Google's own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, non-GAAP operating income excludes some costs, namely, stock-based compensation, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Google's business. Second, stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Third, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management compensates
Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin
for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP.
 We define non-GAAP net income as net income plus stock-based compensation, less the related tax effects. We define non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average shares, on a fully-diluted basis, outstanding as of June 30, 2007. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that Google uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results, we exclude from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS the tax effects associated with stock-based compensation. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results. The same limitations described above regarding Google's use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS together with net income and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP net income and EPS.
. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period since it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement and under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Form 10-Q. Google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.

On July 20, 2007, Google issued a press release announcing that should the Federal Communications Commission adopt a framework requiring greater competition and consumer choice, Google intends to participate in the federal government's upcoming auction of wireless spectrum and commit a minimum of $4.6 billion to bidding in the 700 megahertz (MHz) band.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
Google Intends to Bid in Spectrum Auction If FCC Adopts Consumer Choice and Competition Requirements
Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) announced today that should the Federal Communications Commission adopt a framework requiring greater competition and consumer choice, Google intends to participate in the federal government's upcoming auction of wireless spectrum in the 700 megahertz (MHz) band.
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (July 20, 2007) 
In a filing with the FCC on July 9, Google urged the Commission to adopt rules for the auction that ensure that, regardless of who wins the spectrum at auction, consumers' interests are served. Specifically, Google encouraged the FCC to require the adoption of four types of "open" platforms as part of the license conditions:
 
 
 
 
Today, as a sign of Google's commitment to promoting greater innovation and choices for consumers, CEO Eric Schmidt sent a letter to FCC Chairman Kevin Martin, stating that should the FCC adopt all four license conditions requested above, Google intends to commit a minimum of $4.6 billion to bidding in the upcoming 700 MHz auction.
The complete text of the letter follows:
July 20, 2007
Ex Parte via Electronic Filing
The Honorable Kevin J. Martin
Chairman
Federal Communications Commission
445 12th Street, SW
Washington, D.C. 20554
Re: WC Docket No. 06-150; PS Docket No. 06-229; WT Docket No. 96-86
Dear Chairman Martin:
Google shares your bold vision of using the upcoming 700 MHz spectrum auction to encourage much-needed competition in the wireless and broadband markets. I want to personally applaud your leadership and courage in making the public case for new market entry, and the tangible benefits it will offer all American consumers, including greater availability, higher speeds, and lower prices.
As you know, Google submitted an ex parte letter on July 9th explaining that, in order to promote genuine competition, the Commission must include open platforms as part of the applicable licensing requirements for paired commercial blocks in the Upper 700 MHz Band. In particular, our July 9th letter requested that the Commission should extend to all CMRS-type spectrum licensees clearly delineated, explicitly enforceable, and unwavering obligations to provide (1) open applications, (2) open devices, (3) open wholesale services, and (4) open network access.
The Commission's draft order for the 22 MHz "C" Block in the Upper 700 MHz Band reportedly allocates this block on a REAG basis subject to combinatorial bidding and includes some reference to "open access" principles. While these all are positive steps, unfortunately the current draft order falls short of including the four tailored and enforceable conditions, with meaningful implementation deadlines, that consumer groups, other companies, and Google have sought. In short, when Americans can use the software and handsets of their choice, over open and competitive networks, they win.
It is also my understanding that the Commission's draft order includes a reserve price of $4.6 billion for the "C" Block, apparently to address unsupported claims about any impact from adopting open platforms conditions. We hereby inform you that, should the Commission expressly adopt the four license conditions requested in our July 9th letter  with specific, enforceable, and enduring rules  Google intends to commit a minimum of $4.6 billion to bidding in the upcoming auction.
Sincerely yours,
Eric Schmidt

TAC as a percentage of advertising revenues was 29% in the third quarter, compared to 30% in the second quarter of 2007.
TAC - Traffic Acquisition Costs
The majority of TAC expense is related to amounts ultimately paid to our AdSense partners, which totaled $1.12 billion in the third quarter of 2007. TAC is also related to amounts ultimately paid to certain distribution partners and others who direct traffic to our website, which totaled $105 million in the third quarter of 2007.
Other cost of revenues, which is comprised primarily of data center operational expenses, credit card processing charges as well as content acquisition costs, increased to $441 million, or 10% of revenues, in the third quarter of 2007, compared to $412 million, or 11% of revenues, in the second quarter of 2007.

Stock-Based Compensation (SBC)
-
We currently estimate stock-based compensation charges for grants to employees prior to October 1, 2007 to be approximately $801 million for 2007. This does not include expenses to be recognized related to employee stock awards that are granted after October 1, 2007 or non-employee stock awards that have been or may be granted. We currently anticipate that dilution related to all equity grants to employees will be at or below 2% this year.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
This press release contains forward-looking statements that are based on information available to us as of the date of this press release and our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include statements relating to our expected stock-based compensation charges, the expected dilution related to equity grants to our employees, and our plans to make significant capital expenditures. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, unforeseen changes in our hiring patterns, the amount of stock-based compensation we issue to our service providers, our need to expend capital to accommodate the growth of the business, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2007, which is on file with the SEC and is available on our investor relations website at investor.google.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2007, which will be filed with the SEC in November 2007. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of October 18, 2007, and should not be unduly relied on because Google undertakes no duty to update this information.
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures" and "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow" included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our "recurring core business operating results," meaning our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in
nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
 We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income plus stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenues. Google considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of stock-based compensation so that Google's management and investors can compare Google's recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under FAS 123R, Google's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between Google's recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing Google's management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Google's own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, non-GAAP operating income excludes some costs, namely, stock-based compensation, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Google's business. Second, stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Third, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin.
 We define non-GAAP net income as net income plus stock-based compensation, less the related tax effects. We define non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average shares, on a fully-diluted basis, outstanding as of September 30, 2007. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that Google uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results, we exclude from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS the tax effects associated with stock-based compensation. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results. The same limitations described above regarding Google's use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. Management
Non-GAAP net income and EPS.
compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS together with net income and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP.
. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period since it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement and under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Form 10-Q. Google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.

Exhibit 99.1
Google Will Apply to Participate in FCC Spectrum Auction
Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) announced today that it will apply to participate in the Federal Communications Commission's upcoming auction of wireless spectrum in the 700 megahertz (MHz) band.
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (November 30, 2007) 
As part of the nationally mandated transition to digital television, the 700 MHz spectrum auction  which begins January 24, 2008  will free up spectrum airwaves for more efficient wireless Internet service for consumers. Advocacy by public interest groups and Google earlier this year helped ensure that regardless of which bidders win a key portion of the spectrum up for auction (the so-called "C Block"), they will be required to allow their users to download any software application they want on their mobile device, and to use any mobile devices they would like on that wireless network. The winner must ensure these rights for consumers if the reserve price of $4.6 billion for the C Block is met at auction.
"We believe it's important to put our money where our principles are," said Eric Schmidt, Chairman and CEO, Google. "Consumers deserve more competition and innovation than they have in today's wireless world. No matter which bidder ultimately prevails, the real winners of this auction are American consumers who likely will see more choices than ever before in how they access the Internet."
Schmidt also praised the leadership of FCC Chairman Kevin Martin and his fellow commissioners for adopting the new rights for consumers earlier this year.
Google's formal application to participate in the 700 MHz auction will be filed with the FCC on Monday, December 3, 2007  the required first step in the auction process. Google's application does not include any partners.

Exhibit 99.2
Who's going to win the spectrum auction? Consumers.
by Chris Sacca, Head of Special Initiatives
Here at Google, we see the upcoming 700 megahertz spectrum auction at the Federal Communications Commission as one of the best opportunities consumers will have to enjoy more choices in the world of wireless devices. That's why we announced today that we are applying to participate in the auction.
We already know that regardless of which bidders ultimately win the auction, consumers will be the real winners either way. This is because the eventual winner of a key portion of this spectrum will be required to give its customers the right to download any application they want on their mobile device, and the right to use any device they want on the network (assuming the C Block reserve price of $4.6 billion is met in the auction). That's meaningful progress in our ongoing efforts to help transform the relatively closed wireless world to be more like the open realm of the Internet.
Regardless of how the auction unfolds, we think it's important to put our money where our principles are. Consumers deserve more choices and more competition than they have in the wireless world today. And at a time when so many Americans don't have access to the Internet, this auction provides an unprecedented opportunity to bring the riches of the Net to more people.
While we've written a lot on our blogs and spoken publicly about our plans for the auction, unfortunately you're not going to hear from us about this topic for awhile, and we want to explain why.
Monday, December 3, is the deadline for prospective bidders to apply with the FCC to participate in the auction. Though the auction itself won't start until January 24, 2008, Monday also marks the starting point for the FCC's anti-collusion rules, which prevent participants in the auction from discussing their bidding strategy with each other.
These rules are designed to keep the auction process fair, by keeping bidders from cooperating in anticompetitive ways so as to drive the auction prices in artificial directions. While these rules primarily affect private communications among prospective bidders, the FCC historically has included all forms of public communications in its interpretation of these rules.
All of this means that, as much as we would like to offer a step-by-step account of what's happening in the auction, the FCC's rules prevent us from doing so until the auction ends early next year. So here's a quick primer on how things will unfold:
 
 
 
 
If you're interested in keeping track of the publicly available details of the auction, check out this page on the FCC's website or Google News. In the meantime, my lips will be sealed (something, frankly, that I'm not used to).

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
This press release contains forward-looking statements that are based on information available to us as of the date of this press release and our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include statements relating to our expected stock-based compensation charges, the expected dilution related to equity grants to our employees, and our plans to make significant capital expenditures. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, unforeseen changes in our hiring patterns, the amount of stock-based compensation we issue to our service providers, our need to expend capital to accommodate the growth of the business, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2007, which is on file with the SEC and is available on our investor relations website at investor.google.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, which will be filed with the SEC in February 2008. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of January 31, 2008, and should not be unduly relied on because Google undertakes no duty to update this information.
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-
GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures" and "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow" included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our "recurring core business operating results," meaning our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
 We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income plus stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenues. Google considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of stock-based compensation so that Google's management and investors can compare Google's recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under FAS 123R, Google's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between Google's recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing Google's management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Google's own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, non-GAAP operating income excludes some costs, namely, stock-based compensation, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Google's business. Second, stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Third, the
Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin.
components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP.
 We define non-GAAP net income as net income plus stock-based compensation, less the related tax effects. We define non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average shares, on a fully-diluted basis, outstanding as of December 31, 2007. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that Google uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results, we exclude from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS the tax effects associated with stock-based compensation. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results. The same limitations described above regarding Google's use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS together with net income and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP net income and EPS.
. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period since it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement and under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our
Free cash flow
Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K. Google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
The accompanying tables have more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.

On March 11, 2008, we completed our previously announced acquisition of Click Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation ("DoubleClick"), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as April 13, 2007, as amended (the "Merger Agreement"), that we entered into with DoubleClick and Whopper Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary (the "Sub").
Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Google acquired DoubleClick by means of a merger of the Sub with and into DoubleClick (the "Merger"), with DoubleClick continuing as the surviving corporation after the Merger.
At the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of the capital stock of DoubleClick, each share of DoubleClick common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was converted into an amount in cash equal to the "Calculation Amount" divided by the total number of outstanding shares of DoubleClick common stock plus the total number of shares underlying outstanding options and stock appreciation rights for DoubleClick common stock (such quotient, the "Per Share Amount"). The "Calculation Amount" under the Merger Agreement was approximately $3.24 billion, consisting of $3.11 billion plus the cash and cash equivalents of DoubleClick and its subsidiaries plus the aggregate exercise price for outstanding options and stock appreciation rights for DoubleClick common stock minus unpaid third party expenses incurred by DoubleClick in connection with the Merger and minus all indebtedness for borrowed money of DoubleClick, in each case, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.
At the Effective Time, each vested option and stock appreciation right for DoubleClick common stock was cancelled in exchange for a cash payment equal to the number of shares of DoubleClick common stock underlying such option or stock appreciation right multiplied by the excess, if any, of the Per Share Amount over the strike price for such option or stock appreciation right. At the Effective Time, unvested options and stock appreciation rights were converted into options to purchase Google Class A common stock with economic terms based upon the Per Share Amount in accordance with the Merger Agreement.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, attached as Exhibit 2.1 to the Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 19, 2007 and incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the press release announcing the completion of the Merger is filed with this report as Exhibit 99.1.

Exhibit 99.1
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  April 17, 2008 - Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2008.
"Our ongoing innovation in search, ads, and apps helped drive healthy growth globally across our product lines, yielding another strong quarter for Google," said Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google. "As we integrate DoubleClick into our advertising platform, we see exciting new ways to improve the user experience and increase value for our advertisers and partners. Also, while exercising operational discipline, we continue to explore opportunities that add value to users everywhere and to Google in the long term."
Q1 Financial Summary
Google's results for the quarter ended March 31, 2008, include the operations of DoubleClick Inc. from the date of acquisition, March 11, 2008, through the end of the quarter, and are compared to pre-acquisition results of prior periods. The overall impact of DoubleClick in the first quarter of 2008 was immaterial to revenue and only slightly dilutive to both GAAP and non-GAAP operating income, net income and earnings per share.
Google reported revenues of $5.19 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2008, an increase of 42% compared to the first quarter of 2007 and an increase of 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Google reports its revenues, consistent with GAAP, on a gross basis without deducting traffic acquisition costs, or TAC. In the first quarter of 2008, TAC totaled $1.49 billion, or 29% of advertising revenues.
Google reports operating income, net income, and earnings per share (EPS) on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP measures, as well as free cash flow, an alternative non-GAAP measure of liquidity, are described below and are reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures in the accompanying financial tables.
 
 
 
 
Q1 Financial Highlights 
Google reported revenues of $5.19 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2008, representing a 42% increase over first quarter 2007 revenues of $3.66 billion and a 7% increase over fourth quarter 2007 revenues of $4.83 billion. Google reports its revenues, consistent with GAAP, on a gross basis without deducting TAC.
Revenues 
- Google-owned sites generated revenues of $3.40 billion, or 66% of total revenues, in the first quarter of 2008. This represents a 49% increase over first quarter 2007 revenues of $2.28 billion and a 9% increase over fourth quarter 2007 revenues of $3.12 billion.
Google Sites Revenues
- Google's partner sites generated revenues, through AdSense programs, of $1.69 billion, or 33% of total revenues, in the first quarter of 2008. This represents a 25% increase over network revenues of $1.35 billion generated in the first quarter of 2007 and a 3% increase over fourth quarter 2007 revenues of $1.64 billion.
Google Network Revenues
- Revenues from outside of the United States totaled $2.65 billion, representing 51% of total revenues in the first quarter of 2008, compared to 47% in the first quarter of 2007 and 48% in the fourth quarter of 2007. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the first quarter of 2008, our revenues in the first quarter of 2008 would have been $18 million lower. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant from the first quarter of 2007 through the first quarter of 2008, our revenues in the first quarter of 2008 would have been $202 million lower.
International Revenues
Revenues from the United Kingdom totaled $803 million, representing 15% of revenue in the first quarter of 2008, compared to 16% in the first quarter of 2007 and 14% in the fourth quarter of 2007.
- Aggregate paid clicks, which include clicks related to ads served on Google sites and the sites of our AdSense partners, increased approximately 20% over the first quarter of 2007 and approximately 4% over the fourth quarter of 2007.
Paid Clicks
, the portion of revenues shared with Google's partners, increased to $1.49 billion in the first quarter of 2008. This compares to TAC of $1.44 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007. TAC as a percentage of advertising revenues was 29% in the first quarter, compared to 30% in the fourth quarter of 2007.
TAC - Traffic Acquisition Costs
The majority of TAC expense is related to amounts ultimately paid to our AdSense partners, which totaled $1.34 billion in the first quarter of 2008. TAC is also related to amounts ultimately paid to certain distribution partners and others who direct traffic to our website, which totaled $143 million in the first quarter of 2008.
Other cost of revenues, which is comprised primarily of data center operational expenses, credit card processing charges as well as content acquisition costs, increased to $624 million, or 12% of revenues, in the first quarter of 2008, compared to $516 million, or 11% of revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Other Cost of Revenues -
Pursuant to our acquisition of DoubleClick, we allocated $862 million to identified intangible assets, which have a weighted average useful life of 6.3 years.
Operating expenses, other than cost of revenues, were $1.53 billion in the first quarter of 2008, or 30% of revenues, compared to $1.43 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007, or 30% of revenues. The operating expenses in the first quarter of 2008 included $809 million in payroll-related and facilities expenses, compared to $756 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Operating Expenses -
 In the first quarter of 2008, the total charge related to SBC was $281 million as compared to $245 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Stock-Based Compensation (SBC)
We currently estimate stock-based compensation charges for grants to employees prior to April 1, 2008 to be approximately $1.1 billion for 2008. This does not include expenses to be recognized related to employee stock awards that are granted after April 1, 2008 or non-employee stock awards that have been or may be granted. We currently anticipate that dilution related to all equity grants to employees will be at or below 2% this year.
GAAP operating income in the first quarter of 2008 was $1.55 billion, or 30% of revenues. This compares to GAAP operating income of $1.44 billion, or 30% of revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2007. Non-GAAP operating income in the first quarter of 2008 was $1.83 billion, or 35% of revenues. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $1.69 billion, or 35% of revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Operating Income -
 GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2008 was $1.31 billion as compared to $1.21 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007. Non-GAAP net income was $1.54 billion in the first quarter of 2008, compared to $1.41 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007. GAAP EPS for the first quarter of 2008 was $4.12 on 317 million diluted shares outstanding, compared to $3.79 for the fourth quarter of 2007, on 318 million diluted shares outstanding. Non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter of 2008 was $4.84, compared to $4.43 in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Net Income
 Our effective tax rate was 24% for the first quarter of 2008.
Income Taxes
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the first quarter of 2008 totaled $1.78 billion as compared to $1.69 billion for the fourth quarter of 2007. In the first quarter of 2008, capital expenditures were $842 million, the majority of which was related to IT infrastructure investments, including data centers, servers, and networking equipment. Free cash flow, an alternative non-GAAP measure of liquidity, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. In the first quarter of 2008, free cash flow was $938 million.
Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures
We expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures.
A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, the GAAP measure of liquidity, is included at the end of this release.
 As of March 31, 2008, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $12.1 billion.
Cash
On a worldwide basis, Google employed 19,156 full-time employees as of March 31, 2008, up from 16,805 full-time employees as of December 31, 2007. Of the 2,351 employees added in the first quarter of 2008, approximately 1,500 were associated with DoubleClick. Since the close of the acquisition, Google has conducted a review of its ongoing headcount requirements and approximately 10% of the DoubleClick workforce was laid off in the U.S. in early April.

These statements include statements relating to our success in integrating DoubleClick, our ability to identify and explore new opportunities to improve the user experience, add value to users and Google, and increase value for our advertisers and partners, our expected stock-based compensation charges, the expected dilution related to equity grants to our employees, and our plans to make significant capital expenditures.

Additional information will also be set forth in our report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2008, which will be filed with the SEC in May 2008. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of April 17, 2008, and should not be unduly relied on because Google undertakes no duty to update this information.
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures" and "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow" included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our "recurring core business operating results," meaning our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
 We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income plus stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenues. Google considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of stock-based compensation so that Google's management and investors can compare Google's recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under FAS 123R, Google's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between Google's recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing Google's management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Google's own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, non-GAAP operating income excludes some costs, namely, stock-based compensation, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Google's business. Second, stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Third, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin.
 We define non-GAAP net income as net income plus stock-based compensation, less the related tax effects. We define non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average shares, on a fully-diluted basis, outstanding as of March 31, 2008. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that Google uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results, we exclude from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS the tax effects associated with stock-based compensation. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results. The same limitations described above regarding Google's use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS together with net income and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP net income and EPS.
. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period since it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement and under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K. Google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.

Re: Offer of Employment with Google Inc.

On behalf of Google Inc., I am pleased to offer you the exempt position of Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, reporting to the Chief Executive Officer, subject to the terms and contingencies set forth below. The position is located in Mountain View, California. Your start date shall be August 1, 2008 and you will assume the position of CFO effective August 12, 2008.
You will receive an annual salary of $450,000, which will be paid biweekly and subject to a periodic review. You are eligible to participate in the Company Bonus Program; your annual bonus target will be 150% of base salary. Bonuses under the Company Bonus Plan are discretionary. The actual bonus amount could be larger or smaller than this amount, based on your performance and the performance of the Company. Whether a bonus will be awarded in a particular bonus period, and in what amount, is within Google's sole discretion. Both your base salary and the components of your bonus are subject to periodic review.
Additionally, upon your start date, Google will pay you a one-time Sign-On Bonus of $500,000. This will be taxed as supplemental income.

In the event your employment is terminated within the first six months of your employment, the Cash Bonus payout will be accelerated and paid on the termination date or as soon thereafter as Company business practices allow, but in any case within thirty (30) days of your termination. If you terminate your employment at Google before the one year anniversary of your start date, other than as a result of a breach by Google of this Agreement, you will be required to repay the Sign-On Bonus and Cash Bonus. Any required repayment will be prorated based on the number of remaining calendar days until the one year anniversary of your start date.
Google will pay relocation costs and provide reimbursement for specified moving expenses as outlined in Google's North American Officer Relocation Policy. In order to receive these benefits, you will be required to work with a third party vendor provider designated by Google to assist in employee moves.
As a regular full-time employee you will be eligible for various benefits offered to similarly-situated Google employees in accordance with the terms of Google's policies and benefit plans. Among other things, these benefits currently include medical and dental insurance, life insurance, and a 401(k) retirement plan.

You will be able to change your deferral amount and fund allocation upon your hire. The eligibility requirements and other information regarding these benefits are set forth in
 
more detailed documents that are available from Google. With the exception of the "employment at will" policy discussed herein, Google may, from time to time in its sole discretion, modify or eliminate its policies and the benefits offered to employees.
Upon approval by our Board of Directors, you will be granted four new hire equity grants. Per the Governance Guidelines of the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, the Grant Date of these four equity grants will be on the Wednesday of the week following your start date.
The first award will be a stock option grant to purchase 11,112 shares of Google Class A common stock. Your options will be nonqualified stock options with an exercise price equal to the closing fair market value of the underlying stock on the Grant Date. Your options will vest at the rate of 1/4

Vesting in both of these stock option and GSU awards is contingent on continued employment on the applicable vesting dates.
The third award will be a grant of 910 GSUs. Your GSUs will vest at a rate of 100 percent at six months. At that time, the vested number of GSUs will convert to a number of Google Class A common shares.

The fourth award will be a grant of 910 GSUs. Your GSUs will vest at a rate of 100 percent at twelve months. At that time, the vested number of GSUs will convert to a number of Google Class A common shares. In the event your employment is terminated after six months but prior to the twelve-month vesting date (other than as a result of your resignation), you will immediately vest in this grant.
Please be aware that this program and subsequent programs could be changed at any time, at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Also note that Google makes no representation about the future value of the stock options or GSUs granted herein and you should expect that the value of these grants will fluctuate in the future. Finally, the receipt of such grants shall be conditioned upon the subsequent execution by the grantee of Google's appropriate form of GSU and Stock Option grant agreement.

Exhibit 99.1
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  July 17, 2008 - Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2008.
"Strong international growth as well as sustained traffic increases on Google's web properties propelled us to another strong quarter, despite a more challenging economic environment," said Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google. "As we continue to focus on innovating in our core business of search, ads and apps, we also look forward to enhancing the experience of our users and expanding the reach of our advertisers and partners with new technologies and formats, particularly as our integration of DoubleClick gains momentum and creates new opportunities in display advertising and elsewhere."
Q2 Financial Summary
Google reported revenues of $5.37 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2008, an increase of 39% compared to the second quarter of 2007 and an increase of 3% compared to the first quarter of 2008. Google reports its revenues, consistent with GAAP, on a gross basis without deducting traffic acquisition costs, or TAC. In the second quarter of 2008, TAC totaled $1.47 billion, or 28% of advertising revenues.
Google reports operating income, net income, and earnings per share (EPS) on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP measures, as well as free cash flow, an alternative non-GAAP measure of liquidity, are described below and are reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures in the accompanying financial tables.
 
 
 
Q2 Financial Highlights
Google reported revenues of $5.37 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2008, representing a 39% increase over second quarter 2007 revenues of $3.87 billion and a 3% increase over first quarter 2008 revenues of $5.19 billion. Google reports its revenues, consistent with GAAP, on a gross basis without deducting TAC.
Revenues 
Google-owned sites generated revenues of $3.53 billion, or 66% of total revenues, in the second quarter of 2008. This represents a 42% increase over second quarter 2007 revenues of $2.49 billion and a 4% increase over first quarter 2008 revenues of $3.40 billion.
Google Sites Revenues
Google's partner sites generated revenues, through AdSense programs, of $1.66 billion, or 31% of total revenues, in the second quarter of 2008. This represents a 22% increase over network revenues of $1.35 billion generated in the second quarter of 2007 and a 2% decrease over first quarter 2008 revenues of $1.69 billion.
Google Network Revenues
Revenues from outside of the United States totaled $2.80 billion, representing 52% of total revenues in the second quarter of 2008, compared to 48% in the second quarter of 2007 and 51% in the first quarter of 2008. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant from the first quarter of 2008 through the second quarter of 2008, our revenues in the second quarter of 2008 would have been $88 million lower. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant from the second quarter of 2007 through the second quarter of 2008, our revenues in the second quarter of 2008 would have been $249 million lower.
International Revenues
Revenues from the United Kingdom totaled $774 million, representing 14% of revenue in the second quarter of 2008, compared to 15% in the second quarter of 2007 and 15% in the first quarter of 2008.
Aggregate paid clicks, which include clicks related to ads served on Google sites and the sites of our AdSense partners, increased approximately 19% over the second quarter of 2007 and decreased approximately 1% over the first quarter of 2008.
Paid Clicks
, the portion of revenues shared with Google's partners, decreased to $1.47 billion in the second quarter of 2008. This compares to TAC of $1.49 billion in the first quarter of 2008. TAC as a percentage of advertising revenues was 28% in the second quarter, compared to 29% in the first quarter of 2008.
TAC - Traffic Acquisition Costs
The majority of TAC expense is related to amounts ultimately paid to our AdSense partners, which totaled $1.32 billion in the second quarter of 2008. TAC is also related to amounts ultimately paid to certain distribution partners and others who direct traffic to our website, which totaled $154 million in the second quarter of 2008.
Other cost of revenues, which is comprised primarily of data center operational expenses, amortization of intangible assets, credit card processing charges as well as content acquisition costs, increased to $674 million, or 13% of revenues, in the second quarter of 2008, compared to $624 million, or 12% of revenues, in the first quarter of 2008.
Other Cost of Revenues 
Operating expenses, other than cost of revenues, were $1.64 billion in the second quarter of 2008, or 31% of revenues, compared to $1.53 billion in the first quarter of 2008, or 29% of revenues. The operating expenses in the second quarter of 2008 included $810 million in payroll-related and facilities expenses, compared to $809 million in the first quarter of 2008.
Operating Expenses 
In the second quarter of 2008, the total charge related to SBC was $273 million as compared to $281 million in the first quarter of 2008.
Stock-Based Compensation (SBC)
We currently estimate stock-based compensation charges for grants to employees prior to July 1, 2008 to be approximately $1.1 billion for 2008. This does not include expenses to be recognized related to employee stock awards that are granted after July 1, 2008 or non-employee stock awards that have been or may be granted. We currently anticipate that dilution related to all equity grants to employees will be at or below 2% this year.
GAAP operating income in the second quarter of 2008 was $1.58 billion, or 29% of revenues. This compares to GAAP operating income of $1.55 billion, or 30% of revenues, in the first quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP operating income in the second quarter of 2008 was $1.85 billion, or 34% of revenues. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $1.83 billion, or 35% of revenues, in the first quarter of 2008.
Operating Income 
Interest income and other was $58 million in the second quarter of 2008, compared with $167 million in the first quarter of 2008. The decrease was primarily related to lower yields on our cash balances, as well as lower average cash balances as a result of cash used in the first quarter to acquire DoubleClick; lower net realized gains on the sale of our marketable securities; and an increase in expenses as a result of more activity under our foreign exchange risk management program.
Interest Income and Other, Net 
GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2008 was $1.25 billion as compared to $1.31 billion in the first quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP net income was $1.47 billion in the second quarter of 2008, compared to $1.54 billion in the first quarter of 2008. GAAP EPS for the second quarter of 2008 was $3.92 on 318 million diluted shares outstanding, compared to $4.12 for the first quarter of 2008, on 317 million diluted shares outstanding. Non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter of 2008 was $4.63, compared to $4.84 in the first quarter of 2008.
Net Income
Our effective tax rate was 24% for the second quarter of 2008.
Income Taxes
Net cash provided by operating activities for the second quarter of 2008 totaled $1.77 billion as compared to $1.78 billion for the first quarter of 2008. In the second quarter of 2008, capital expenditures were $698 million, the majority of which was related to IT infrastructure investments, including data centers, servers, and networking equipment. Free cash flow, an alternative non-GAAP measure of liquidity, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. In the second quarter of 2008, free cash flow was $1.07 billion.
Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures
We expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures.
A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, the GAAP measure of liquidity, is included at the end of this release.
As of June 30, 2008, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $12.7 billion.
Cash
On a worldwide basis, Google employed 19,604 full-time employees as of June 30, 2008, up from 19,156 full-time employees as of March 31, 2008.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include statements relating to our success in integrating DoubleClick, our ability to innovate in our core business, enhance the experience of our users and expand the reach of our advertisers and partners with new technologies and formats, our expected stock-based compensation charges, the expected dilution related to equity grants to our employees, and our plans to make significant capital expenditures.
Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, difficulties in integrating DoubleClick into our business, unforeseen changes in our hiring patterns, the amount of stock-based compensation we issue to our service providers, our need to expend capital to accommodate the growth of the business, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2008, which is on file with the SEC and is available on our investor relations website at investor.google.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2008, which will be filed with the SEC in August 2008. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of July 17, 2008, and Google undertakes no duty to update this information.
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures" and "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow" included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our "recurring core business operating results," meaning our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
 We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income plus stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenues. Google considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of stock-based compensation so that Google's management and investors can compare Google's recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under FAS 123R, Google's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between Google's recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing Google's management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Google's own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, non-GAAP operating income excludes some costs, namely, stock-based compensation, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Google's business. Second, stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Third, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin.
 We define non-GAAP net income as net income plus stock-based compensation, less the related tax effects. We define non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average shares, on a fully-diluted basis, outstanding as of June 30, 2008. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that Google uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results, we exclude from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS the tax effects associated with stock-based compensation. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results. The same limitations described above regarding Google's use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS together with net income and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP net income and EPS.
. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period since it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement and under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K. Google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.

Exhibit 99.1
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  October 16, 2008 - Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2008.
"We had a good third quarter with strong traffic and revenue growth across all of our major geographies thanks to the underlying strength of our core search and ads business. The measurability and ROI of search-based advertising remain key assets for Google," said Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google. "While we are realistic about the poor state of the global economy, we will continue to manage Google for the long term, driving improvements to search and ads, while also investing in future growth areas such as enterprise, mobile, and display."
Q3 Financial Summary
Google reported revenues of $5.54 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2008, an increase of 31% compared to the third quarter of 2007 and an increase of 3% compared to the second quarter of 2008. Google reports its revenues, consistent with GAAP, on a gross basis without deducting traffic acquisition costs (TAC). In the third quarter of 2008, TAC totaled $1.50 billion, or 28% of advertising revenues.
Google reports operating income, net income, and earnings per share (EPS) on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP measures, as well as free cash flow, an alternative non-GAAP measure of liquidity, are described below and are reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures in the accompanying financial tables.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Q3 Financial Highlights
Google reported revenues of $5.54 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2008, representing a 31% increase over third quarter 2007 revenues of $4.23 billion and a 3% increase over second quarter 2008 revenues of $5.37 billion. Google reports its revenues, consistent with GAAP, on a gross basis without deducting TAC.
Revenues 
- Google-owned sites generated revenues of $3.67 billion, or 67% of total revenues, in the third quarter of 2008. This represents a 34% increase over third quarter 2007 revenues of $2.73 billion and a 4% increase over second quarter 2008 revenues of $3.53 billion.
Google Sites Revenues
- Google's partner sites generated revenues, through AdSense programs, of $1.68 billion, or 30% of total revenues, in the third quarter of 2008. This represents a 15% increase over network revenues of $1.45 billion generated in the third quarter of 2007 and a 1% increase over second quarter 2008 revenues of $1.66 billion.
Google Network Revenues
- Revenues from outside of the United States totaled $2.85 billion, representing 51% of total revenues in the third quarter of 2008, compared to 48% in the third quarter of 2007 and 52% in the second quarter of 2008. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant from the second quarter of 2008 through the third quarter of 2008, our revenues in the third quarter of 2008 would have been $59 million higher. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant from the third quarter of 2007 through the third quarter of 2008, our revenues in the third quarter of 2008 would have been $168 million lower.
International Revenues
In the third quarter, we recognized a benefit of $34 million to revenue through our foreign exchange risk management program.
Revenues from the United Kingdom totaled $776 million, representing 14% of revenue in the third quarter of 2008, compared to 16% in the third quarter of 2007 and 14% in the second quarter of 2008.
 Aggregate paid clicks, which include clicks related to ads served on Google sites and the sites of our AdSense partners, increased approximately 18% over the third quarter of 2007 and increased approximately 4% over the second quarter of 2008.
Paid Clicks
, the portion of revenues shared with Google's partners, increased to $1.50 billion in the third quarter of 2008. This compares to TAC of $1.47 billion in the second quarter of 2008. TAC as a percentage of advertising revenues was 28% in the third quarter, compared to 28% in the second quarter of 2008.
TAC - Traffic Acquisition Costs
The majority of TAC expense is related to amounts ultimately paid to our AdSense partners, which totaled $1.33 billion in the third quarter of 2008. TAC is also related to amounts ultimately paid to certain distribution partners and others who direct traffic to our website, which totaled $167 million in the third quarter of 2008. 
Other cost of revenues, which is comprised primarily of data center operational expenses, amortization of intangible assets, content acquisition costs as well as credit card processing charges, increased to $678 million, or 12% of revenues, in the third quarter of 2008, compared to $674 million, or 13% of revenues, in the second quarter of 2008.
Other Cost of Revenues -
Operating expenses, other than cost of revenues, were $1.63 billion in the third quarter of 2008, or 29% of revenues, compared to $1.64 billion in the second quarter of 2008, or 31% of revenues. The operating expenses in the third quarter of 2008 included $859 million in payroll-related and facilities expenses, compared to $810 million in the second quarter of 2008.
Operating Expenses -
 In the third quarter of 2008, the total charge related to SBC was $280 million as compared to $273 million in the second quarter of 2008.
Stock-Based Compensation (SBC)
We currently estimate stock-based compensation charges for grants to employees prior to October 1, 2008 to be approximately $1.1 billion for 2008. This does not include expenses to be recognized related to employee stock awards that are granted after October 1, 2008 or non-employee stock awards that have been or may be granted.
GAAP operating income in the third quarter of 2008 was $1.74 billion, or 31% of revenues. This compares to GAAP operating income of $1.58 billion, or 29% of revenues, in the second quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP operating income in the third quarter of 2008 was $2.02 billion, or 37% of revenues. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $1.85 billion, or 34% of revenues, in the second quarter of 2008.
Operating Income -
Interest income and other was $21 million in the third quarter of 2008, compared with $58 million in the second quarter of 2008. The decrease was primarily related to an increase in expenses substantially due to more activity under our foreign exchange risk management program. The cost of the options used to manage our foreign exchange risk is amortized on a mark-to-market basis. As a result, the amount of amortization expense we recognize in any particular quarter is impacted by how much the option moves into or out of the money, as well as the underlying currency's volatility.
Interest Income and Other, Net 
 GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2008 was $1.35 billion as compared to $1.25 billion in the second quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP net income was $1.56 billion in the third quarter of 2008, compared to $1.47 billion in the second quarter of 2008. GAAP EPS for the third quarter of 2008 was $4.24 on 318 million diluted shares outstanding, compared to $3.92 for the second quarter of 2008, on 318 million diluted shares outstanding. Non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter of 2008 was $4.92, compared to $4.63 in the second quarter of 2008.
Net Income
 Our effective tax rate was 24% for the third quarter of 2008.
Income Taxes
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the third quarter of 2008 totaled $2.18 billion as compared to $1.77 billion for the second quarter of 2008. In the third quarter of 2008, capital expenditures were $452 million, the majority of which was related to IT infrastructure investments, including data centers, servers, and networking equipment. Free cash flow, an alternative non-GAAP measure of liquidity, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. In the third quarter of 2008, free cash flow was $1.73 billion.
Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures
We expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures.
A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, the GAAP measure of liquidity, is included at the end of this release. 
 As of September 30, 2008, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $14.4 billion.
Cash
On a worldwide basis, Google employed 20,123 full-time employees as of September 30, 2008, up from 19,604 full-time employees as of June 30, 2008.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 
This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include statements relating to our expected stock-based compensation charges and our plans to make significant capital expenditures. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, unforeseen changes in our hiring patterns and our need to expend capital to accommodate the growth of the business, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2008, which is on file with the SEC and is available on our investor relations website at investor.google.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2008, which will be filed with the SEC in November 2008. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of October 16, 2008, and Google undertakes no duty to update this information.
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures" and "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow" included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our "recurring core business operating results," meaning our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. 
 We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income plus stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenues. Google considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of stock-based compensation so that Google's management and investors can compare Google's recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under FAS 123R, Google's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between Google's recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing Google's management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Google's own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin.
First, non-GAAP operating income excludes some costs, namely, stock-based compensation, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Google's business. Second, stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Third, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP.
 We define non-GAAP net income as net income plus stock-based compensation, less the related tax effects. We define non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average shares, on a fully-diluted basis, outstanding as of September 30, 2008. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that Google uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results, we exclude from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS the tax effects associated with stock-based compensation. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results. The same limitations described above regarding Google's use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS together with net income and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP net income and EPS.
. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period since it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement and under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K. Google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.

Exhibit 99.1
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  January 22, 2009  Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) today announced financial results for the quarter and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008.
"Google performed well in the fourth quarter, despite an increasingly difficult economic environment. Search query growth was strong, revenues were up in most verticals, and we successfully contained costs," said Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google. "It's unclear how long the global downturn will last, but our focus remains on the long term, and we'll continue to invest in Google's core search and ads business as well as in strategic growth areas such as display, mobile, and enterprise."
Google also announced today that it is planning to offer employees a voluntary, one-for-one stock option exchange. This program, intended to create more incentives for employees to remain at Google and contribute to achieving its business objectives, is currently scheduled to begin on January 29, 2009 and end on March 3, 2009, unless Google is required or opts to extend the offer period to a later date. Please see the section "Employee Stock Option Exchange" below for more details.

TAC is also related to amounts ultimately paid to certain distribution partners and others who direct traffic to our website, which totaled $190 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. 
 Other cost of revenues, which is comprised primarily of data center operational expenses, amortization of intangible assets, content acquisition costs as well as credit card processing charges, increased to $707 million, or 12% of revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to $678 million, or 12% of revenues, in the third quarter of 2008.
Other Cost of Revenues
 Operating expenses, other than cost of revenues, were $1.65 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008, or 29% of revenues, compared to $1.72 billion in the third quarter of 2008, or 31% of revenues. The operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2008 included $890 million in payroll-related and facilities expenses, compared to $859 million in the third quarter of 2008.
Operating Expenses
 In the fourth quarter of 2008, the total charge related to SBC was $286 million as compared to $280 million in the third quarter of 2008.
Stock-Based Compensation (SBC)
 Our Board of Directors has approved an exchange offer to allow employees the opportunity to exchange all or a portion of their existing stock options for the same number of new options. This program is currently scheduled to commence on January 29, 2009 and end on March 3, 2009 at 6:00 a.m. Pacific Time, unless Google is required or opts to extend the offer period to a later date. Currently, we expect that new options will have an exercise price equal to the closing price per share of our common stock on March 2, 2009 and that stock options with exercise prices above this closing price will be eligible for exchange, but this may change. Generally, all employees with options are eligible to participate in the program (Eric Schmidt, Sergey Brin, and Larry Page do not hold options).
Employee Stock Option Exchange
The number of Google shares subject to outstanding options will not change as a result of the exchange offer. We have designed the program so that new options issued as part of this
exchange offer will be subject to a new vesting schedule which adds 12 months to the original applicable vesting dates. In addition, new options will vest no sooner than 6 months after the close of the offer period. The expiration dates of the new options will remain the same as the expiration dates of the options being exchanged.
We expect to take a modification charge estimated to be $460 million over the vesting periods of the new options. These vesting periods range from six months to approximately five years. Assuming the offer proceeds according to our planned timeline, this modification charge will be recorded as additional stock based compensation beginning in the first quarter of 2009. This estimate assumes an exchange price of approximately $300 and that all eligible underwater options will be exchanged under the program. As a result, the actual amount of the modification charge is likely to change.
We currently estimate stock-based compensation charges for grants to employees prior to January 1, 2009 to be approximately $1.04 billion for 2009. This estimate does not include expenses to be recognized related to employee stock awards that are granted after January 1, 2009 or non-employee stock awards that have been or may be granted. It also does not include the estimated $460 million modification charge related to our employee stock option exchange.
 GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter of 2008 was $1.86 billion, or 33% of revenues. This compares to GAAP operating income of $1.65 billion, or 30% of revenues, in the third quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter of 2008 was $2.15 billion, or 38% of revenues. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $2.02 billion, or 37% of revenues, in the third quarter of 2008.
Operating Income
 We have determined that certain of our assets are impaired and require us to recognize non-cash impairment charges related to those investments. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the impairment charge on these assets was $1.09 billion, including charges of $726 million and $355 million related to our investments in AOL and Clearwire, respectively.
Impairment on Equity Investments
 Interest income and other, net increased to $70 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with interest income and other, net of $21 million in the third quarter of 2008.
Interest Income and Other, Net
 Our GAAP effective tax rate was 54% for the fourth quarter of 2008 and 28% for the year, which includes the effect of the impairment on our equity investments of $1.09 billion in the fourth quarter and the legal settlement of $95 million with the Authors Guild and the AAP in the third quarter. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate, defined as our income before income taxes adding back impairment charges, legal settlement, and stock-based compensation divided into the result obtained by subtracting the related tax benefits from our provision for income taxes, for the fourth quarter and for the year was 27% and 24%, respectively.
Income Taxes
 GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $382 million as compared to $1.29 billion in the third quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP net income was $1.62 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to $1.56 billion in the third quarter of 2008. GAAP EPS for the
Net Income
fourth quarter of 2008 was $1.21 on 317 million diluted shares outstanding, compared to $4.06 for the third quarter of 2008, on 318 million diluted shares outstanding. Non-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $5.10, compared to $4.92 in the third quarter of 2008.
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the fourth quarter of 2008 totaled $2.12 billion as compared to $2.18 billion for the third quarter of 2008. In the fourth quarter of 2008, capital expenditures were $368 million, the majority of which was related to IT infrastructure investments, including data centers, servers, and networking equipment. Free cash flow, an alternative non-GAAP measure of liquidity, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. In the fourth quarter of 2008, free cash flow was $1.75 billion.
Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures
We expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures.
A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, the GAAP measure of liquidity, is included at the end of this release.
 As of December 31, 2008, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities were $15.85 billion.
Cash
On a worldwide basis, Google employed 20,222 full-time employees as of December 31, 2008, up from 20,123 full-time employees as of September 30, 2008.

ABOUT THE OPTION EXCHANGE PROGRAM
The option exchange program described in this press release has not commenced. At the time the option exchange begins, if at all, Google will provide eligible employees with written materials explaining the precise terms and timing of the option exchange. Holders of options to buy Google's Class A Common Stock that are eligible to participate in this option exchange should read these materials carefully when they become available because they will contain important information about the option exchange. Upon commencement of the program, Google will also file these written materials with the SEC as part of a tender offer statement. Google's stockholders and optionholders will be able to obtain these written materials and other documents filed by Google with the SEC free of charge from the SEC's website at .

ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures", "Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP effective tax rate," and "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow" included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be
indicative of our "recurring core business operating results," meaning our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
 We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income plus stock-based compensation and, for the third quarter of 2008, the expense related to the settlement agreement with the Authors Guild and the AAP. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenues. Google considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of stock-based compensation and one-time events so that Google's management and investors can compare Google's recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under FAS 123R, Google's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between Google's recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing Google's management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Google's own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, non-GAAP operating income excludes some costs, namely, stock-based compensation, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Google's business. Second, stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Third, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin.
 We define non-GAAP net income as net income plus stock-based compensation, and, for the third quarter of 2008, the expense related to the settlement agreement, and, for the fourth quarter of 2008, non-cash impairment charges less the related tax effects of such items. We define non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average shares, on a fully-diluted basis, outstanding as of December 31, 2008. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that Google uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating
Non-GAAP net income and EPS.
results, we exclude from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS the tax effects associated with stock-based compensation, the expense related to the settlement agreement in the third quarter of 2008 and the impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2008. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results. The same limitations described above regarding Google's use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS together with net income and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP.
We define the non-GAAP effective tax rates as income before income taxes adding back the expense related to the settlement agreement in the third quarter of 2008, the impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2008 and stock-based compensation divided into the result obtained by subtracting the related tax benefits from our provision for income taxes. We consider this non-GAAP financial measure to be a useful metric for management and investors because it excludes the effect of certain discrete items so that Google's management and investors can compare Google's recurring earnings results over multiple periods. The same limitations described above regarding Google's use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of the non-GAAP effective tax rates. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from the non-GAAP effective tax rates and evaluating the non-GAAP effective tax rates together with the effective tax rates computed on a GAAP basis.
Non-GAAP effective tax rates.
We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement and under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K. Google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.

Announcing Google's Employee Option Exchange Program
Laszlo Bock, VP, People Operations
Today we announced our plans to do something more for the people who are responsible for Google's successour employees. Recognizing that about 85% of our employees have at least some stock options that are underwater (i.e., have an exercise price higher than the current market price of our common stock), we plan to offer our employees the opportunity to exchange those options. Our goal is to continue to reward our employees for their contributions and do everything we can to keep them engaged and focused on serving our users.
Here's how the employee option exchange program would work:
 
 
 
 
 
 
The number of Google shares subject to outstanding options will not change as a result of this employee-only option exchange. The total number of options expected to be exchanged in this program represents less than 3% of total shares currently outstanding.
We expect to take a modification charge estimated to be $460 million over the vesting periods of the new options. These vesting periods range from six months to approximately five years. This modification charge will be recorded as additional stock based compensation beginning in the first quarter of 2009. This estimate assumes an exchange price of approximately $300 per share and that all eligible underwater options will be exchanged under this program. As a result, this estimate is subject to change.
If you're interested in learning more about this employee-only stock option exchange, we encourage you to read our related SEC filings when they become available.
.
The option exchange described in this post has not launched. When the option exchange begins, Google will provide employees with written materials explaining the terms and timing. Eligible optionholders should read these materials carefully when they become available because they will contain important information about the option exchange. When the offer period begins, Google will file these materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as part of a tender offer statement. You will be able to obtain these written materials and other documents filed by Google with the SEC free of charge from the SEC's website at
www.sec.gov
The $300 exchange price provided above is intended as an example only. We expect that the actual modification charge we take as a result of the option exchange will be determined based on the exercise price and number of options exchanged as well as the closing price of our stock on March 2, 2009, unless Google is required or opts to extend the offer period.

2008. Excluding gains related to our foreign exchange risk management program, had foreign exchange rates remained constant from the fourth quarter of 2008 through the first quarter of 2009, our revenues in the first quarter of 2009 would have been $120 million higher. Excluding gains related to our foreign exchange risk management program, had foreign exchange rates remained constant from the first quarter of 2008 through the first quarter of 2009, our revenues in the first quarter of 2009 would have been $429 million higher.
Revenues from the United Kingdom totaled $733 million, representing 13% of revenue in the first quarter of 2009, compared to 15% in the first quarter of 2008 and 12% in the fourth quarter of 2008.

, the portion of revenues shared with Google's partners, decreased to $1.44 billion in the first quarter of 2009. This compares to TAC of $1.48 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. TAC as a percentage of advertising revenues was 27% in the first quarter of 2009, compared to 27% in the fourth quarter of 2008.
TACTraffic Acquisition Costs
The majority of TAC is related to amounts ultimately paid to our AdSense partners, which totaled $1.23 billion in the first quarter of 2009. TAC also includes amounts ultimately paid to certain distribution partners and others who direct traffic to our website, which totaled $207 million in the first quarter of 2009.

billion in the fourth quarter of 2008, or 29% of revenues. The operating expenses in the first quarter of 2009 included $774 million in payroll-related and facilities expenses, compared to $890 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.
In the first quarter of 2009, the total charge related to SBC was $277 million as compared to $286 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Stock-Based Compensation (SBC)
In March 2009, Google completed an offer to exchange certain employee stock options issued under Google's 2004 Stock Plan (Exchange Offer). Certain previously granted options were exchanged for new, lower-priced stock options granted on a one-for-one basis. Options for an aggregate of approximately 7.6 million shares of Google's Class A common stock were exchanged. Options granted pursuant to the Exchange Offer have an exercise price of $308.57 per share, the closing price of Google's Class A common stock as reported by The Nasdaq Global Select Market on March 6, 2009. Options granted pursuant to the Exchange Offer have a new vesting schedule determined by adding 12 months to each vesting date under the exchanged options' vesting schedule. In addition, new options will vest no sooner than September 9, 2009. The Exchange Offer will result in a modification charge related to SBC of $360 million to be recognized over the vesting periods of the new options. These vesting periods range from six months to approximately five years. We recorded $11 million of this $360 million modification charge in the first quarter of 2009.
We currently estimate SBC charges for grants to employees prior to April 1, 2009 to be approximately $1.1 billion for 2009. This estimate does not include expenses to be recognized related to employee stock awards that are granted after March 31, 2009 or non-employee stock awards that have been or may be granted.
GAAP operating income in the first quarter of 2009 was $1.88 billion, or 34% of revenues. This compares to GAAP operating income of $1.86 billion, or 33% of revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2008. Non-GAAP operating income in the first quarter of 2009 was $2.16 billion, or 39% of revenues. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $2.15 billion, or 38% of revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2008.

Free cash flow, an alternative non-GAAP measure of liquidity, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. In the first quarter of 2009, free cash flow was $1.99 billion.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include statements regarding investments in our core and emerging businesses, expected stock-based compensation charges (including the expected modification charge resulting from the option exchange program), and our plans to make significant capital expenditures. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, unforeseen changes in our hiring patterns and our need to expend capital to accommodate the growth of the business, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, which is on file with the SEC and is available on our investor relations website at investor.google.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2009, which we expect to file with the SEC in May 2009. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of April 16, 2009 and Google undertakes no duty to update this information.
 
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures" and "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow" included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our "recurring core business operating results," meaning our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
 We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income plus stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenues. Google considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of stock-based
Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin.
 
compensation so that Google's management and investors can compare Google's recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under FAS 123R, Google's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between Google's recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing Google's management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Google's own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, non-GAAP operating income excludes some costs, namely, stock-based compensation, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Google's business. Second, stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Third, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP.
 We define non-GAAP net income as net income plus stock-based compensation, and, for the fourth quarter of 2008, non-cash impairment charges less the related tax effects of such items. We define non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average outstanding shares, on a fully-diluted basis. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that Google uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results, we exclude from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS the tax effects associated with stock-based compensation and the impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2008. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results. The same limitations described above regarding Google's use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts
Non-GAAP net income and EPS.
 
excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS together with net income and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP.
. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement and under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K. Google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.

(xi) to allow Participants to satisfy withholding tax obligations by electing to have the Company withhold from the Shares or cash to be issued upon exercise or vesting of an Award that number of Shares or cash having a Fair Market Value equal to the minimum amount required to be withheld. The Fair Market Value of any Shares to be withheld will be determined on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. All elections by a Participant to have Shares or cash withheld for this purpose will be made in such form and under such conditions as the Administrator may deem necessary or advisable;
(xii) to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the Company any instrument required to effect the grant of an Award previously granted by the Administrator;
(xiii) to allow a Participant to defer the receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of Shares that would otherwise be due to such Participant under an Award;
(xiv) to implement an Award Transfer Program;
(xv) to determine whether Awards will be settled in Shares, cash or in any combination thereof;
(xvi) to determine whether Awards will be adjusted for Dividend Equivalents;
(xvii) to create Other Stock Based Awards for issuance under the Plan;
(xviii) to establish a program whereby Service Providers designated by the Administrator can reduce compensation otherwise payable in cash in exchange for Awards under the Plan;
(xix) to impose such restrictions, conditions or limitations as it determines appropriate as to the timing and manner of any resales by a Participant or other subsequent transfers by the Participant of any Shares issued as a result of or under an Award, including without limitation, (A) restrictions under an insider trading policy, and (B) restrictions as to the use of a specified brokerage firm for such resales or other transfers; and
(xx) to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for administering the Plan.
(c) . The Administrator's decisions, determinations and interpretations will be final and binding on all Participants and any other holders of Awards.

5. . Nonstatutory Stock Options, Restricted Stock, Stock Appreciation Rights, Performance Units, Performance Shares, Restricted Stock Units and Other Stock Based Awards may be granted to Service Providers. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to Employees.
Eligibility
6. .
Limitations
(a) . Each Option will be designated in the Award Agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option. However, notwithstanding such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by the Participant during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, such Options will be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For purposes of this Section 6(a), Incentive Stock Options will be taken into account in the order in which they were granted. The Fair Market Value of the Shares will be determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted.
ISO $100,000 Rule
(b) . Neither the Plan nor any Award shall confer upon a Participant any right with respect to continuing his or her relationship as a Service Provider, nor shall they interfere in any way with the right of the Participant or the right of the Company or its Parent or Subsidiaries to terminate such relationship at any time, with or without cause.
No Rights as a Service Provider
(c) . The following limitations shall apply to Awards under the Plan:
162(m) Limitation
(i) . No Service Provider will be granted, in any Fiscal Year, Options and/or SARs to purchase more than 1,000,000 Shares.
Option and SAR Share Annual Limit
(ii) . No Service Provider will be granted, in any Fiscal Year, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Units and/or Performance Shares to purchase more than 500,000 Shares.
Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Units and Performance Shares Annual Limit
(iii) . For purposes of qualifying grants of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares or Performance Units as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator, in its discretion, may set restrictions based upon the achievement of Performance Goals. The Performance Goals shall be set by the Administrator on or before the latest date permissible to enable the Restricted Stock Units, Restricted Stock, Performance Shares or Performance Units to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code. In granting Restricted Stock Units, Restricted Stock, Performance Shares or Performance Units which are intended to qualify under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator shall follow any procedures determined by it from time to time to be necessary or appropriate to ensure qualification of the Award under Section 162(m) of the Code (e.g., in determining the Performance Goals).
Section 162(m) Performance Restrictions
(iv) The foregoing limitations will be adjusted proportionately in connection with any change in the Company's capitalization as described in Section 15 of the Plan.
(v) If an Award is cancelled in the same Fiscal Year in which it was granted (other than in connection with a transaction described in Section 15 of the Plan), the cancelled Award will be counted against the limits set forth in subsections (i) and (ii) above. For this purpose, if the exercise price of an Option is reduced, the transaction will be treated as a cancellation of the Option and the grant of a new Option.
7. .
Stock Options
(a) . The term of each Option will be stated in the Award Agreement. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the term will be ten (10) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement. Moreover, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Participant who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Incentive Stock Option will be five (5) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement.
Term of Option
(b) .
Option Exercise Price and Consideration
(i) . The per Share exercise price for the Shares to be issued pursuant to exercise of an Option will be determined by the Administrator, subject to the following:
Exercise Price
(1) In the case of an Incentive Stock Option
(A) granted to an Employee who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price will be no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
(B) granted to any Employee other than an Employee described in paragraph (A) immediately above, the per Share exercise price will be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
(2) In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option, the per Share exercise price will be determined by the Administrator. In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the per Share exercise price will be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Incentive Stock Options may be granted with a per Share exercise price of less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant pursuant to a merger or other corporate transaction.
(ii) . At the time an Option is granted, the Administrator will fix the period within which the Option may be exercised and will determine any conditions that must be satisfied before the Option may be exercised.
Waiting Period and Exercise Dates
(c) . The Administrator will determine the acceptable form of consideration for exercising an Option, including the method of payment. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the Administrator will determine the acceptable form of consideration at the time of grant. Such consideration to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws may consist entirely of:
Form of Consideration
(i) cash;
(ii) check;
(iii) promissory note;
(iv) other Shares which meet the conditions established by the Administrator to avoid adverse accounting consequences (as determined by the Administrator);
(v) consideration received by the Company under a cashless exercise program implemented by the Company in connection with the Plan;
(vi) a reduction in the amount of any Company liability to the Participant, including any liability attributable to the Participant's participation in any Company-sponsored deferred compensation program or arrangement;
(vii) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment; or
(viii) such other consideration and method of payment for the issuance of Shares to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.
(d) .
Exercise of Option
(i) . Any Option granted hereunder will be exercisable according to the terms of the Plan and at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Administrator and set forth in the Award Agreement. An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.
Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Stockholder
An Option will be deemed exercised when the Company receives: (x) written or electronic notice of exercise (in accordance with the Award Agreement) from the person entitled to exercise the Option, and (y) full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised. Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Award Agreement and the Plan. Shares issued upon exercise of an Option will be issued in the name of the Participant or, if requested by the Participant, in the name of the Participant and his or her spouse. Until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder will exist with respect to the Awarded Stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company will issue (or cause to be issued) such Shares promptly after the Option is exercised. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the Record Date is prior to the date the Shares are issued, except as provided in Section 15 of the Plan or the applicable Award Agreement.
Exercising an Option in any manner will decrease the number of Shares thereafter available for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.
(ii) . If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider, other than upon the Participant's death or Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for three (3) months following the Participant's termination. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if on the date of termination the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will revert to the Plan on the date one (1) month following the Participant's termination. If after termination the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified by the Administrator, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.
Termination of Relationship as a Service Provider
(iii) . If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider as a result of the Participant's Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following the Participant's termination. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if on the date of termination the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will revert to the Plan on the date one (1) month following the Participant's termination. If after termination the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.
Disability of Participant
(iv) . If a Participant dies while a Service Provider, the Option may be exercised following the Participant's death within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of death, or to the extent it vests pursuant to Section 23(a)(i) hereof (but in no event may the Option be exercised later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement), by the Participant's designated beneficiary, provided such beneficiary has been designated prior to Participant's death in a form acceptable to the Administrator. If no such beneficiary has been designated by the Participant, then such Option may be exercised by the personal representative of the Participant's estate or by the person(s) to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to the Participant's will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution. In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following Participant's death. If the Option is not so exercised within the time specified herein, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.
Death of Participant
(e) . The Administrator may at any time offer to buy out for a payment in cash or Shares an Option previously granted based on such terms and conditions as the Administrator shall establish and communicate to the Participant at the time that such offer is made.
Buyout Provisions

Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Administrator, at any time and from time to time, may grant Shares of Restricted Stock to Service Providers in such amounts as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine.

Removal of Restrictions
(f) . During the Period of Restriction, Service Providers holding Shares of Restricted Stock granted hereunder may exercise full voting rights with respect to those Shares, unless the Administrator determines otherwise.
Voting Rights
(g) . During the Period of Restriction, Service Providers holding Shares of Restricted Stock will be entitled to receive all dividends and other distributions paid with respect to such Shares unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement. If any such dividends or distributions are paid in Shares, the Shares will be subject to the same restrictions on transferability and forfeitability as the Shares of Restricted Stock with respect to which they were paid.
Dividends and Other Distributions

At the discretion of the Administrator, the payment upon SAR exercise may be in cash, in Shares of equivalent value, or in some combination thereof.
(h) . The Administrator may at any time offer to buy out for a payment in cash or Shares a Stock Appreciation Right previously granted based on such terms and conditions as the Administrator shall establish and communicate to the Participant at the time that such offer is made.
Buyout Provisions
10. .
Performance Units and Performance Shares
(a) . Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, Performance Units and Performance Shares may be granted to Service Providers at any time and from time to time, as will be determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion. Subject to Section 6(c)(ii), the Administrator will have complete discretion in determining the number of Performance Units and Performance Shares granted to each Participant.
Grant of Performance Units/Shares
(b) . Each Performance Unit will have an initial value that is established by the Administrator on or before the date of grant. Each Performance Share will have an initial value equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant.
Value of Performance Units/Shares
(c) . The Administrator will set performance objectives in its discretion which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the number or value of Performance Units/Shares that will be paid out to the Service Providers. The time period during which the performance objectives must be met will be called the "Performance Period." Each Award of Performance Units/ Shares will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the Performance Period, and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine. The Administrator may set performance objectives based upon the achievement of Company-wide, divisional, or individual goals, applicable federal or state securities laws, or any other basis determined by the Administrator in its discretion.
Performance Objectives and Other Terms
(d) . After the applicable Performance Period has ended, the holder of Performance Units/Shares will be entitled to receive a payout of the number of Performance Units/Shares earned by the Participant over the Performance Period, to be determined as a function of the extent to which the corresponding performance objectives have been achieved. After the grant of a Performance Unit/Share, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any performance objectives for such Performance Unit/Share.
Earning of Performance Units/Shares
(e) . Payment of earned Performance Units/Shares will be made as soon after the expiration of the applicable Performance Period at the time determined by the Administrator. The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may pay earned Performance Units/Shares in the form of cash, in Shares (which have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the value of the earned Performance Units/Shares at the close of the applicable Performance Period) or in a combination thereof.

Other Stock Based Awards
13. . Unless the Administrator provides otherwise, vesting of Awards granted hereunder will be suspended during any unpaid leave of absence and will resume on the date the Participant returns to work on a regular schedule as determined by the Company; provided, however, that no vesting credit will be awarded for the time vesting has been suspended during such leave of absence. A Service Provider will not cease to be an Employee in
Leaves of Absence

st

Notwithstanding the preceding, the number of Shares subject to any Award always shall be a whole number.
Adjustments
(b) . In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator will notify each Participant as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction. The Administrator in its discretion may provide for a Participant to have the right to exercise his or her Award, to the extent applicable, until ten (10) days prior to such transaction as to all of the Awarded Stock covered thereby, including Shares as to which the Award would not otherwise be exercisable. In addition, the Administrator may provide that any Company repurchase option or forfeiture rights applicable to any Award shall lapse 100%, and that any Award vesting shall accelerate 100%, provided the proposed dissolution or liquidation takes place at the time and in the manner contemplated. To the extent it has not been previously exercised or vested, an Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action.
Dissolution or Liquidation
(c) .
Merger or Change in Control
(i) . In the event of a merger or Change in Control, each outstanding Option and SAR shall be assumed or an equivalent option or SAR substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. With respect to Options and SARs granted to an Outside Director that are assumed or substituted for, if immediately prior to or after the merger or Change in Control the Participant's status as a Director or a director of the successor corporation, as applicable, is terminated other than upon a voluntary resignation by the Participant, then the Participant shall fully vest in and have the right to exercise such Options and SARs as to all of the Awarded Stock, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested or exercisable. Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, in the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Option or SAR, the Participant shall fully vest in and have the right to exercise the Option or SAR as to all of the Awarded Stock, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested or exercisable. If an Option or SAR is not assumed or substituted in the event of a merger or Change in Control, the Administrator shall notify the Participant in writing or electronically that the Option or SAR shall be exercisable, to the extent vested, for a period of up to fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, and the Option or SAR shall terminate upon the expiration of such
Stock Options and SARS
period. For the purposes of this paragraph, the Option or SAR shall be considered assumed if, following the merger or Change in Control, the option or stock appreciation right confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share of Awarded Stock subject to the Option or SAR immediately prior to the merger or Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the merger or Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the merger or Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of the Option or SAR, for each Share of Awarded Stock subject to the Option or SAR, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or Change in Control. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more performance goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such performance goals without the Participant's consent; provided, however, a modification to such performance goals only to reflect the successor corporation's post-merger or post-Change in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.
(ii) . In the event of a merger or Change in Control, each outstanding Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award and Restricted Stock Unit awards shall be assumed or an equivalent Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award and Restricted Stock Unit award substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. With respect to Awards granted to an Outside Director that are assumed or substituted for, if immediately prior to or after the merger or Change in Control the Participant's status as a Director or a director of the successor corporation, as applicable, is terminated other than upon a voluntary resignation by the Participant, then the Participant shall fully vest in such Awards, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested. Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, in the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award or Restricted Stock Unit award, the Participant shall fully vest in the Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award or Restricted Stock Unit including as to Shares which would not otherwise be vested. For the purposes of this paragraph, a Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award and Restricted Stock Unit award shall be considered assumed if, following the merger or Change in Control, the award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Award immediately prior to the merger or Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the merger or Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the merger or Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received, for each Share and each unit/right to acquire a Share subject to the Award, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or Change in Control. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more performance goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such performance goals without the Participant's consent; provided, however, a modification to such performance goals only to reflect the successor corporation's post-merger or post-Change in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.
Restricted Stock, Performance Shares, Performance Units, Restricted Stock Units and Other Stock Based Awards
16. . The date of grant of an Award will be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the determination granting such Award, or such other later date as is determined by the Administrator. Notice of the determination will be provided to each Participant within a reasonable time after the date of such grant.
Date of Grant
17. . Subject to Section 22 of the Plan, the Plan will become effective upon its adoption by the Board. It will continue in effect for a term of ten (10) years unless terminated earlier under Section 18 of the Plan.
Term of Plan
18. .
Amendment and Termination of the Plan
(a) . The Board may at any time amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan.
Amendment and Termination
(b) . The Company will obtain stockholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with Applicable Laws.
Stockholder Approval
(c) . Subject to Section 20 of the Plan, no amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan will impair the rights of any Participant, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Participant and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Participant and the Company. Termination of the Plan will not affect the Administrator's ability to exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to Awards granted under the Plan prior to the date of such termination.
Effect of Amendment or Termination
19. .
Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares
(a) . Shares will not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Award unless the exercise of such Award and the issuance and delivery of such Shares will comply with Applicable Laws and will be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
Legal Compliance
(b) . As a condition to the exercise or receipt of an Award, the Company may require the person exercising or receiving such Award to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise or receipt that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required.
Investment Representations
20. . Notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Plan or an Award to the contrary, if any one or more of the provisions (or any part thereof) of this Plan or the Awards shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such provision shall be modified so as to make it valid, legal and enforceable, and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions (or any part thereof) of the Plan or Award, as applicable, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
Severability
21. . The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, will relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority will not have been obtained.
Inability to Obtain Authority
22. . The Plan will be subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date the Plan is adopted. Such stockholder approval will be obtained in the manner and to the degree required under Applicable Laws.
Stockholder Approval
23.
Vesting Acceleration of Awards Upon Death.
(a) .
Stock Options and SARs
(i) . If a Participant dies while a Service Provider, and at the time of such Participant's death the Participant is not an Officer, all Shares covered by the unvested portion of each outstanding Option and SAR held by the Participant will immediately accelerate upon the Participant's death and become exercisable pursuant to Section 7(d)(iv) hereof.
Non-Officer Participants
(ii) . If a Participant dies while a Service Provider, and at the time of such Participant's death the Participant is an Officer, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of each outstanding Option and SAR held by the Participant as of the Participant's death will immediately revert to the Plan on the date one (1) month following the Participant's death, and the Participant will not be entitled to exercise such Shares pursuant to Section 7(d)(iv) hereof; provided, however, that all Shares covered by the vested portion of the Option or SAR, as applicable, shall remain exercisable pursuant to Section 7(d)(iv) hereof.
Officers
(b) . If a Participant dies while a Service Provider, and at the time of such Participant's death the Participant is not an Officer, then each outstanding Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award or Restricted Stock Unit held by the Participant upon the Participant's death will vest, including as to Shares which would not otherwise be vested, and with respect to such Awards with performance-based vesting, all performance goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at 100% on-target levels and all other terms and conditions met. Participants who are Officers at the time of their death will not be entitled to such accelerated vesting.

In June 2009, Google Inc. invested approximately $2.6 million in the Series B preferred stock financing of 23andMe, Inc., a privately-held personal genetics company dedicated to helping individuals understand their own genetic information through DNA analysis technologies and web-based interactive tools. Google previously invested approximately $3.9 million in the Series A preferred stock financing of 23andMe in May 2007. In November 2007, Google purchased additional shares of Series A preferred stock of 23andMe held by an investor in 23andMe's Series A preferred stock financing for approximately $500,000. Google made this investment in the Series B preferred stock financing of 23andMe pursuant to Google's existing right to purchase its pro rata share of new securities issued by 23andMe. Google continues to hold a minority interest in 23andMe as a result of the Series B investment. 23andMe's Series B financing involved a number of additional investors including New Enterprise Associates. Anne Wojcicki, who is a co-founder of 23andMe and who is also a stockholder and member of the board of directors, is married to Sergey Brin, Google's President, Technology and one of its founders. Sergey also holds approximately 38% of Google's Class B common stock. Prior to Google's investment in 23andMe's Series B preferred stock financing, Sergey also invested approximately $10 million in 23andMe's convertible debt financing, which was converted into Series B preferred stock as part of this financing transaction. In June 2009, Google also entered into a lease agreement with 23andMe. Google's Audit Committee reviewed and approved the investment and lease transactions as part of Google's procedures for entering into transactions with related parties. The valuation of the Series B investment was determined by negotiations between New Enterprise Associates and 23andMe in which Google played no role. The terms and conditions of the lease with 23andMe were reviewed by an independent real estate appraiser. As part of its decision-making process, the Audit Committee was advised by independent counsel.

Exhibit 99.1
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  July 16, 2009 - Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2009.
"Google had a very good quarter, especially given the continued macro-economic downturn. While most of the world's largest economies shrank, Google's year-over-year revenues were up 3%. These results highlight the enduring strength of our business model and our responsible efforts to manage expenses in a way that puts us in a good position for the economic upturn, when it occurs," said Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google. "We remain focused on investing in technical innovation to drive growth in our core and new businesses."
Q2 Financial Summary
Google reported revenues of $5.52 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, an increase of 3% compared to the second quarter of 2008.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include statements regarding our expected stock-based compensation charges and our plans to invest in our core and new businesses and make significant capital expenditures. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ
from the results predicted include, among others, unforeseen changes in our hiring patterns and our need to expend capital to accommodate the growth of the business, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, which is on file with the SEC and is available on our investor relations website at investor.google.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, which we expect to file with the SEC in August 2009. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of July 16, 2009 and Google undertakes no duty to update this information.
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures" and "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow" included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our "recurring core business operating results," meaning our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
 We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income plus stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenues. Google considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors
Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin.
because they exclude the effect of stock-based compensation so that Google's management and investors can compare Google's recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under FAS 123R, Google's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between Google's recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing Google's management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Google's own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, non-GAAP operating income excludes some costs, namely, stock-based compensation, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Google's business. Second, stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Third, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP.
 We define non-GAAP net income as net income plus stock-based compensation, less the related tax effects of such items. We define non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average outstanding shares, on a fully-diluted basis. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that Google uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results, we exclude from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS the tax effects associated with stock-based compensation. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results. The same limitations described above regarding Google's use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS together with net income and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP net income and EPS.
. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions and
Free cash flow
strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement and under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K. Google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
The accompanying tables have more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.

On July 7, 2009, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee of Google's Board of Directors jointly approved revisions to the standard compensation arrangements for non-employee members of Google's Board.
Under the revised compensation arrangements, each non-employee director who was fully vested in all previously awarded equity grants as of July 7, 2009 (John Doerr, John Hennessey, Arthur Levinson, Paul Otellini, and Ram Shriram) received a one-time grant of $500,000 in Google Stock Units (GSUs). Consistent with past officer equity granting practice, these grants took place on the first Wednesday of the month following the date they were approved (August 5, 2009).
Each non-employee director who was not fully vested in all previously awarded equity grants on July 7, 2009 (Ann Mather and Shirley Tilghman) will receive a $500,000 grant of GSUs on the first Wednesday of the month following the final vesting date of their previous equity grants.
Beginning with the first stockholder meeting after receipt of the one-time grant described above, each director will receive an annual $350,000 GSU grant and an annual $75,000 cash retainer. These grants and payments will be made on the first Wednesday of the month following each annual stockholder meeting.
The exact number of GSUs comprising the grants will be calculated by dividing the target dollar amount by the closing price of Google's stock on the day prior to grant. These GSUs will vest at the rate of 1/4
th
on the first anniversary of the grant date and an additional 1/16
th
each quarter thereafter.
Under the revised compensation arrangements, the Chair of the Audit Committee will also receive an additional annual cash retainer of $25,000 beginning after the annual stockholder meeting following his or her initial grant. This cash payment will be made on the first Wednesday of the month following each annual stockholder meeting. Assuming Ann Mather remains Chair of the Audit Committee, she will receive her first retainer in 2011.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include statements regarding our expected stock-based compensation charges and our plans to invest heavily in our business and make significant capital expenditures. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, unforeseen changes in our hiring patterns and our need to expend capital to accommodate the growth of the business, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, which is on file with the SEC and is available on our investor relations website at investor.google.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2009, which we expect to file with the SEC in November 2009. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of October 15, 2009, and Google undertakes no duty to update this information.
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, and free cash flow. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures" and "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow" included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our "recurring core business operating results," meaning our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
 We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income plus stock-based compensation and, in the third quarter of 2008, a non-recurring cash charge. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenues. Google considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of stock-based compensation and one-time events so that Google's management and investors can compare Google's recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under FAS 123R, Google's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between Google's recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing Google's management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Google's own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, non-GAAP operating income
Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin.
excludes some costs, namely, stock-based compensation, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Google's business. Second, stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Third, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP.
We define non-GAAP net income as net income plus stock-based compensation and, in the third quarter of 2008, a non-recurring cash charge, less the related tax effect. We define non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average outstanding shares, on a fully-diluted basis. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that Google uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results, we exclude from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS the tax effects associated with stock-based compensation and the non-recurring cash charge in the third quarter of 2008. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results. The same limitations described above regarding Google's use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS together with net income and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP net income and EPS.
. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement and under the caption "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K. Google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.

On November 9, 2009, Google announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire AdMob, Inc. In connection with the acquisition, the attached letter was sent to the 32 holders of AdMob preferred and common stock that we do not yet have a reasonable belief are "accredited investors" for purposes of the private placement of shares of Google's Class A common stock in the acquisition of Admob in accordance with Regulation D. To the extent these holders do not certify that they are "accredited investors", they will receive only cash consideration unless the issuance of Google stock to them would comply with Rule 506, including the use by these holders of a "purchaser representative" in accordance with Regulation D. In accordance with Rule 135c(d) of the Securities Act of 1933, a copy of the notice is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
November 9, 2009
Dear AdMob Stockholder:
As indicated in the attached press release, dated today, AdMob and Google have signed a merger agreement pursuant to which AdMob will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Google. The closing of the merger will occur after we obtain all regulatory clearances and satisfy other customary closing conditions.
Immediately prior to the closing of the merger, all the preferred stock of AdMob will convert into common stock of AdMob. Then, at the closing, all the common stock of AdMob will convert into either cash consideration or Google's Class A common stock.
As a condition to your being able to elect to receive Google stock as merger consideration, rather than cash consideration, you must execute and return the attached acknowledgment with a box checked that indicates, as set forth in greater detail in the attached acknowledgment, that:
 
OR
 
OR
 
If you do not return the attached form signed and with boxes 1, 2 or 3 checked in a timely manner or if you return the attached form indicating that are not an accredited investor and will neither be appointing your own purchaser representative nor using the the purchaser representative that we will provide you without charge, then you will not have an opportunity to elect to receive Google stock as merger consideration and you will, subject to the closing of the merger, receive cash consideration by default.
If the attached Qualified Holder Certification is not received by AdMob by Friday, November 20, 2009, you may not be able to elect to receive Google stock consideration.
If you sign, complete (by checking boxes 1, 2 or 3) and return the attached acknowledgement in a timely manner, then we will send you a form for electing to receive Google stock consideration, rather than cash consideration, as well as a confidential information statement, to inform your decision as to whether to elect to receive Google stock or cash consideration.
The Google stock consideration to be issued in the merger will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.

On January 12, 2010, Google posted on the Official Google Blog an announcement that it was the target of a cyber attack and that it will be reviewing the feasibility of its business operations in China. A copy of the blogpost is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
(d) Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
A new approach to China
Like many other well-known organizations, we face cyber attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis. In mid-December, we detected a highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure originating from China that resulted in the theft of intellectual property from Google. However, it soon became clear that what at first appeared to be solely a security incidentalbeit a significant onewas something quite different.
First, this attack was not just on Google. As part of our investigation we have discovered that at least twenty other large companies from a wide range of businessesincluding the Internet, finance, technology, media and chemical sectorshave been similarly targeted. We are currently in the process of notifying those companies, and we are also working with the relevant U.S. authorities.
Second, we have evidence to suggest that a primary goal of the attackers was accessing the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists. Based on our investigation to date we believe their attack did not achieve that objective. Only two Gmail accounts appear to have been accessed, and that activity was limited to account information (such as the date the account was created) and subject line, rather than the content of emails themselves.
Third, as part of this investigation but independent of the attack on Google, we have discovered that the accounts of dozens of U.S.-, China- and Europe-based Gmail users who are advocates of human rights in China appear to have been routinely accessed by third parties. These accounts have not been accessed through any security breach at Google, but most likely via phishing scams or malware placed on the users' computers.
We have already used information gained from this attack to make infrastructure and architectural improvements that enhance security for Google and for our users. In terms of individual users, we would advise people to deploy reputable anti-virus and anti-spyware programs on their computers, to install patches for their operating systems and to update their web browsers. Always be cautious when clicking on links appearing in instant messages and emails, or when asked to share personal information like passwords online. You can read more here about our cyber-security recommendations. People wanting to learn more about these kinds of attacks can read this U.S. government report (PDF), Nart Villeneuve's blog and this presentation on the GhostNet spying incident.
We have taken the unusual step of sharing information about these attacks with a broad audience not just because of the security and human rights implications of what we have unearthed, but also because this information goes to the heart of a much bigger global debate about freedom of speech. In the last two decades, China's economic reform programs and its citizens' entrepreneurial flair have lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese people out of poverty. Indeed, this great nation is at the heart of much economic progress and development in the world today.
We launched Google.cn in January 2006 in the belief that the benefits of increased access to information for people in China and a more open Internet outweighed our discomfort in agreeing to censor some results. At the time we made clear that "we will carefully monitor conditions in China, including new laws and other restrictions on our services. If we determine that we are unable to achieve the objectives outlined we will not hesitate to reconsider our approach to China."
These attacks and the surveillance they have uncoveredcombined with the attempts over the past year to further limit free speech on the webhave led us to conclude that we should review the feasibility of our business operations in China. We have decided we are no longer willing to continue censoring our results on Google.cn, and so over the next few weeks we will be discussing with the Chinese government the basis on which we could operate an unfiltered search engine within the law, if at all. We recognize that this may well mean having to shut down Google.cn, and potentially our offices in China.
The decision to review our business operations in China has been incredibly hard, and we know that it will have potentially far-reaching consequences. We want to make clear that this move was driven by our executives in the United States, without the knowledge or involvement of our employees in China who have worked incredibly hard to make Google.cn the success it is today. We are committed to working responsibly to resolve the very difficult issues raised.

On January 7, 2010, On2 Technologies, Inc. ("On2"), Google Inc. ("Google"), Oxide Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Google ("Merger Sub I") and Oxide LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Google ("Merger Sub II") entered into Amendment No. 1 (the "Amendment") to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 4, 2009, by and among On2, Google and Merger Sub I (the "Merger Agreement"). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, as amended, Merger Sub I will be merged with and into the Company and, as a result, the Company will continue as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Google (the "First Step Merger"). As soon as practicable thereafter, the Company will merge with and into Merger Sub II and, as a result, Merger Sub II will continue as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of Google (the "Second Step Merger" and, taken together with the First Step Merger, the "Merger").
As a result of the amendment to the Merger Agreement, Google filed a supplement, dated January 15, 2010 (the "Supplement"), to the definitive proxy statement/prospectus, dated November 3, 2009, which forms a part of a registration statement on Form S-4, as amended (File No. 333-161858) (the "Registration Statement"), that Google filed on September 11, 2009 in connection with the proposed Merger. The Registration Statement includes a proxy statement of On2 and also constitutes a prospectus of Google. The supplement to the definitive proxy statement/prospectus constitutes a supplement to the prospectus of Google with respect to the shares of Google Class A Common Stock to be issued to On2 stockholders in connection with the proposed Merger and also constitutes a supplement to On2's proxy statement with respect to the February 17, 2010 reconvened special meeting of On2 stockholders to consider and vote to adopt the Merger Agreement, as amended. In connection therewith, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, P.C. rendered a revised opinion regarding certain tax matters. A copy of its opinion is attached hereto as Exhibit 8.1.
This report is also being filed for the purpose of filing as exhibits the document listed in Item 9.01 below, which is hereby incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement, as amended and as supplemented by the Supplement or otherwise pursuant to requirements of Form 8-K.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 8.1
Google Inc.
1600 Amphitheatre Parkway
Mountain View, CA 94043
Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as counsel to Google Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), in connection with the preparation and execution of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 4, 2009, by and among Parent, On2 Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Company") and Oxide Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub I"), as amended by Amendment No. 1 to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 7, 2010, by and among Parent, Company, Merger Sub I and Oxide LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub II") (as amended, the "Agreement"). Pursuant to the Agreement, (i) Merger Sub I will merge with and into Company (the "First Step Merger"), with Company as the surviving entity of the First Step Merger and (ii) as soon as practicable following the First Step Merger and as part of a single integrated transaction with the First Step Merger, Parent will cause Company to merge with and into Merger Sub II, a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, with Merger Sub II continuing as the surviving entity (the "Second Step Merger," and taken together with the First Step Merger, the "Integrated Merger").
The Integrated Merger and certain other matters contemplated by the Agreement are described in the Registration Statement on Form S-4 of Parent, as amended (the "Registration Statement"), which includes the proxy statement/prospectus/information statement relating to the Integrated Merger, as amended by the prospectus supplement (as amended, the "Prospectus"). This opinion is being rendered pursuant to the requirements of Item 21(a) of Form S-4 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Unless otherwise indicated, any capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined have the meaning ascribed to them in the Agreement or the Registration Statement.
In connection with this opinion, we have examined and are familiar with the Agreement, the Registration Statement, and such other presently existing documents, records and matters of law as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of our opinion. In addition, we have assumed, without any independent investigation or examination thereof (i) that the Integrated Merger will be consummated in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement and in the manner contemplated by the Prospectus, the First Step Merger and the Second Step Merger will be effective under applicable state law, and that the parties have complied with and, if applicable, will continue to comply with, the covenants, conditions and other provisions contained in the Agreement without any waiver, breach or amendment thereof; (ii) the continuing truth and accuracy at all times through the effective time of the Second Step Merger (the "Effective Time") of the tax representation letters to be delivered to us by Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II, and Company; (iii) the continuing truth and accuracy at all times through the Effective Time of the statements, representations and warranties made by Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II, and Company in the Agreement or the Prospectus or otherwise made to us; and (iii) that any such statements, representations or warranties made "to the knowledge" or based on the belief or intention of Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II, or Company or similarly qualified are true and accurate, and will continue to be true and accurate at all times through the Effective Time, without such qualification.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, and to the limitations, qualifications, assumptions, and caveats set forth herein and in the Prospectus, the statements of law and legal conclusions contained in the Registration Statement under the caption "Update to Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Integrated Merger," constitute the opinion of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, as to the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Integrated Merger.
This opinion represents and is based upon our best judgment regarding current U.S. federal income tax laws including the Code, existing judicial decisions, administrative regulations and published rulings and procedures. Because this opinion is being delivered prior to the Effective Time, it must be considered prospective and dependent on future events. There can be no assurance that changes in the law will not take place that could affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Integrated Merger, or that contrary positions may not be taken by the Internal Revenue Service or the courts. In the event any of the facts, statements, descriptions, covenants, representations, warranties, or assumptions upon which we have relied is incorrect, our opinion might be adversely affected and may not be relied upon.
This opinion addresses only matters set forth herein. This opinion does not address any other U.S. federal tax consequences or any state, local, or non-U.S. tax consequences that may result from the Integrated Merger or any other transaction (including any transaction contemplated by the Agreement or undertaken in connection with or in contemplation of the Integrated Merger).
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion on Form 8-K. We also consent to the reference to our firm name wherever appearing in the Registration Statement with respect to the discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Integrated Merger, including the Prospectus constituting a part thereof, and any amendment thereto. In giving this consent, we do not thereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder, nor do we thereby admit that we are experts with respect to any part of such Registration Statement within the meaning of the term "experts" as used in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder.
Very truly yours,

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include statements regarding our strategy to invest in our products, our expected stock-based compensation charges and our plans to make significant capital expenditures. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, unforeseen changes in our hiring patterns and our need to expend capital to accommodate the growth of the business, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, which is on file with the SEC and is available on our investor relations website at investor.google.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also
 
be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, which we expect to file with the SEC in February 2010. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of January 21, 2010, and Google undertakes no duty to update this information.
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, and free cash flow. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures" and "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow" included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our "recurring core business operating results," meaning our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
 We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income plus stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenues. Google considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of stock-based compensation and one-time events so that Google's management and investors can compare Google's recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under FAS 123R, Google's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between Google's recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing Google's management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Google's own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are a number of limitations related to the
Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin.
 
use of non-GAAP operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, non-GAAP operating income excludes some costs, namely, stock-based compensation, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Google's business. Second, stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Third, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP.
 We define non-GAAP net income as net income plus stock-based compensation and, in the fourth quarter of 2008, non-cash impairment charges, less the related tax effects. We define non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average outstanding shares, on a fully-diluted basis. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that Google uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results, we exclude from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS the tax effects associated with stock-based compensation and the impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2008. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results. The same limitations described above regarding Google's use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS together with net income and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP net income and EPS.
. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement and under the caption "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K. Google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.

On November 30, 2009, Larry Page and Sergey Brin each adopted stock trading plans in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Google's policies regarding stock transactions. In the future, they will begin selling a portion of their Google stock pursuant to these stock trading plans.
Larry is a Co-Founder of Google and serves as Google's President, Products and Sergey is also a Co-Founder of Google and serves as its President, Technology.
These pre-arranged stock trading plans were adopted in order to allow Larry and Sergey to sell a portion of their Google stock over time as part of their respective long-term strategies for individual asset diversification and liquidity. The transactions under these plans will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 and Form 144 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Using these plans, they can gradually diversify their investment portfolios and can spread stock trades out over an extended period of time to reduce market impact. Because these plans were established well in advance of a trade, they also help avoid concerns about whether these officers had material, non-public information when they made a decision to sell their stock.
Larry and Sergey currently hold approximately 57.7 million shares of Class B common stock, which represents approximately 18% of Google's outstanding capital stock and approximately 59% of the voting power of Google's outstanding capital stock. Under the terms of these Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, and as a part of a five year diversification plan, Larry and Sergey each intend to sell approximately 5 million shares. If Larry and Sergey complete all the planned sales under these Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, they would continue to collectively own approximately 47.7 million shares, which would represent approximately 15% of Google's outstanding capital stock and approximately 48% of the voting power of Google's outstanding capital stock (assuming no other sales and conversions of Google capital stock occur).
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include statements regarding our plans to heavily invest in innovation, our expected stock-based compensation charges and our plans to make significant capital expenditures. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, unforeseen changes in our hiring patterns and our need to expend capital to accommodate the growth of the business, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, which is on file with the SEC and is available on our investor relations website at investor.google.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, which we expect to file with the SEC in May 2010. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of April 15, 2010, and Google undertakes no duty to update this information.
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, and free cash flow. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures" and "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow" included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our "recurring core business operating results," meaning our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
 We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income plus stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenues. Google considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of stock-based compensation and one-time events so that Google's management and investors can compare Google's recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under FASB ASC Topic 718, Google's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between Google's recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing Google's management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Google's own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, non-GAAP operating income excludes some costs, namely, stock-based compensation, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Google's business. Second, stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Third, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin.
 We define non-GAAP net income as net income plus stock-based compensation less the related tax effects. We define non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average outstanding shares, on a fully-diluted basis. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that Google uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating
Non-GAAP net income and EPS.
results, we exclude from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS the tax effects associated with stock-based compensation. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results. The same limitations described above regarding Google's use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS together with net income and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP.
. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement and under the caption "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K. Google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.

Such terms and conditions include, but are not limited to, the exercise price, the time or times when Awards may be exercised (which may be based on performance criteria), any vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture or repurchase restrictions, and any restriction or limitation regarding any Award or the Shares relating thereto, based in each case on such factors as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine;

(xi) to allow Participants to satisfy withholding tax obligations by electing to have the Company withhold from the Shares or cash to be issued upon exercise or vesting of an Award that number of Shares or cash having a Fair Market Value equal to the minimum amount required to be withheld. The Fair Market Value of any Shares to be withheld will be determined on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. All elections by a Participant to have Shares or cash withheld for this purpose will be made in such form and under such conditions as the Administrator may deem necessary or advisable;
(xii) to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the Company any instrument required to effect the grant of an Award previously granted by the Administrator;
(xiii) to allow a Participant to defer the receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of Shares that would otherwise be due to such Participant under an Award;
(xiv) to implement an Award Transfer Program;
(xv) to determine whether Awards will be settled in Shares, cash or in any combination thereof;
(xvi) to determine whether Awards will be adjusted for Dividend Equivalents;
(xvii) to create Other Stock Based Awards for issuance under the Plan;
(xviii) to establish a program whereby Service Providers designated by the Administrator can reduce compensation otherwise payable in cash in exchange for Awards under the Plan;
(xix) to impose such restrictions, conditions or limitations as it determines appropriate as to the timing and manner of any resales by a Participant or other subsequent transfers by the Participant of any Shares issued as a result of or under an Award, including without limitation, (A) restrictions under an insider trading policy, and (B) restrictions as to the use of a specified brokerage firm for such resales or other transfers; and

Eligibility
6. .
Limitations
(a) . Each Option will be designated in the Award Agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option. However, notwithstanding such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by the Participant during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, such Options will be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For purposes of this Section 6(a), Incentive Stock Options will be taken into account in the order in which they were granted. The Fair Market Value of the Shares will be determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted.
ISO $100,000 Rule
(b) . Neither the Plan nor any Award shall confer upon a Participant any right with respect to continuing his or her relationship as a Service Provider, nor shall they interfere in any way with the right of the Participant or the right of the Company or its Parent or Subsidiaries to terminate such relationship at any time, with or without cause.
No Rights as a Service Provider
(c) . The following limitations shall apply to Awards under the Plan:
162(m) Limitation
(i) . No Service Provider will be granted, in any Fiscal Year, Options and/or SARs to purchase more than 1,000,000 Shares.
Option and SAR Share Annual Limit
(ii) . No Service Provider will be granted, in any Fiscal Year, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Units and/or Performance Shares to purchase more than 500,000 Shares.
Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Units and Performance Shares Annual Limit
(iii) . For purposes of qualifying grants of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares or Performance Units as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator, in its discretion, may set restrictions based upon the achievement of Performance Goals. The Performance Goals shall be set by the Administrator on or before the latest date permissible to enable the Restricted Stock Units, Restricted Stock, Performance Shares or Performance Units to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code. In granting Restricted Stock Units, Restricted Stock, Performance Shares or Performance Units which are intended to qualify under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator shall follow any procedures determined by it from time to time to be necessary or appropriate to ensure qualification of the Award under Section 162(m) of the Code (e.g., in determining the Performance Goals).
Section 162(m) Performance Restrictions
(iv) The foregoing limitations will be adjusted proportionately in connection with any change in the Company's capitalization as described in Section 15 of the Plan.
(v) If an Award is cancelled in the same Fiscal Year in which it was granted (other than in connection with a transaction described in Section 15 of the Plan), the cancelled Award will be counted against the limits set forth in subsections (i) and (ii) above. For this purpose, if the exercise price of an Option is reduced, the transaction will be treated as a cancellation of the Option and the grant of a new Option.
7. .
Stock Options
(a) . The term of each Option will be stated in the Award Agreement. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the term will be ten (10) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement. Moreover, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Participant who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Incentive Stock Option will be five (5) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement.
Term of Option
(b) .
Option Exercise Price and Consideration
(i) . The per Share exercise price for the Shares to be issued pursuant to exercise of an Option will be determined by the Administrator, subject to the following:
Exercise Price
(1) In the case of an Incentive Stock Option
(A) granted to an Employee who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price will be no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
(B) granted to any Employee other than an Employee described in paragraph (A) immediately above, the per Share exercise price will be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
(2) In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option, the per Share exercise price will be determined by the Administrator. In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the per Share exercise price will be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Incentive Stock Options may be granted with a per Share exercise price of less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant pursuant to a merger or other corporate transaction.
(ii) . At the time an Option is granted, the Administrator will fix the period within which the Option may be exercised and will determine any conditions that must be satisfied before the Option may be exercised.
Waiting Period and Exercise Dates
(c) . The Administrator will determine the acceptable form of consideration for exercising an Option, including the method of payment. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the Administrator will determine the acceptable form of consideration at the time of grant. Such consideration to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws may consist entirely of:
Form of Consideration
(i) cash;
(ii) check;
(iii) promissory note;
(iv) other Shares which meet the conditions established by the Administrator to avoid adverse accounting consequences (as determined by the Administrator);
(v) consideration received by the Company under a cashless exercise program implemented by the Company in connection with the Plan;
(vi) a reduction in the amount of any Company liability to the Participant, including any liability attributable to the Participant's participation in any Company-sponsored deferred compensation program or arrangement;
(vii) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment; or
(viii) such other consideration and method of payment for the issuance of Shares to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.
(d) .
Exercise of Option
(i) . Any Option granted hereunder will be exercisable according to the terms of the Plan and at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Administrator and set forth in the Award Agreement. An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.
Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Stockholder
An Option will be deemed exercised when the Company receives: (x) written or electronic notice of exercise (in accordance with the Award Agreement) from the person entitled to exercise the Option, and (y) full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised. Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Award Agreement and the Plan. Shares issued upon exercise of an Option will be issued in the name of the Participant or, if requested by the Participant, in the name of the Participant and his or her spouse. Until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder will exist with respect to the Awarded Stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company will issue (or cause to be issued) such Shares promptly after the Option is exercised. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the Record Date is prior to the date the Shares are issued, except as provided in Section 15 of the Plan or the applicable Award Agreement.
Exercising an Option in any manner will decrease the number of Shares thereafter available for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.
(ii) . If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider, other than upon the Participant's death or Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for three (3) months following the Participant's termination. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if on the date of termination the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will revert to the Plan on the date one (1) month following the Participant's termination. If after termination the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified by the Administrator, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.
Termination of Relationship as a Service Provider
(iii) . If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider as a result of the Participant's Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following the Participant's termination. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if on the date of termination the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will revert to the Plan on the date one (1) month following the Participant's termination. If after termination the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.
Disability of Participant
(iv) . If a Participant dies while a Service Provider, the Option may be exercised following the Participant's death within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of death, or to the extent it vests pursuant to Section 23(a)(i) hereof (but in no event may the Option be exercised later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement), by the Participant's designated beneficiary, provided such beneficiary has been designated prior to Participant's death in a form acceptable to the Administrator. If no such beneficiary has been designated by the Participant, then such Option may be exercised by the personal representative of the Participant's estate or by the person(s) to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to the Participant's will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution. In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following Participant's death. If the Option is not so exercised within the time specified herein, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.
Death of Participant
(e) . The Administrator may at any time offer to buy out for a payment in cash or Shares an Option previously granted based on such terms and conditions as the Administrator shall establish and communicate to the Participant at the time that such offer is made.

(f) . During the Period of Restriction, Service Providers holding Shares of Restricted Stock granted hereunder may exercise full voting rights with respect to those Shares, unless the Administrator determines otherwise.
Voting Rights
(g) . During the Period of Restriction, Service Providers holding Shares of Restricted Stock will be entitled to receive all dividends and other distributions paid with respect to such Shares unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement. If any such dividends or distributions are paid in Shares, the Shares will be subject to the same restrictions on transferability and forfeitability as the Shares of Restricted Stock with respect to which they were paid.

Buyout Provisions
10. .
Performance Units and Performance Shares
(a) . Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, Performance Units and Performance Shares may be granted to Service Providers at any time and from time to time, as will be determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion. Subject to Section 6(c)(ii), the Administrator will have complete discretion in determining the number of Performance Units and Performance Shares granted to each Participant.
Grant of Performance Units/Shares
(b) . Each Performance Unit will have an initial value that is established by the Administrator on or before the date of grant. Each Performance Share will have an initial value equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant.
Value of Performance Units/Shares
(c) . The Administrator will set performance objectives in its discretion which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the number or value of Performance Units/Shares that will be paid out to the Service Providers. The time period during which the performance objectives must be met will be called the "Performance Period." Each Award of Performance Units/ Shares will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the Performance Period, and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine. The Administrator may set performance objectives based upon the achievement of Company-wide, divisional, or individual goals, applicable federal or state securities laws, or any other basis determined by the Administrator in its discretion.
Performance Objectives and Other Terms
(d) . After the applicable Performance Period has ended, the holder of Performance Units/Shares will be entitled to receive a payout of the number of Performance Units/Shares earned by the Participant over the Performance Period, to be determined as a function of the extent to which the corresponding performance objectives have been achieved. After the grant of a Performance Unit/Share, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any performance objectives for such Performance Unit/Share.

Other Stock Based Awards
13. . Unless the Administrator provides otherwise, vesting of Awards granted hereunder will be suspended during any unpaid leave of absence and will resume on the date the Participant returns to work on a regular schedule as determined by the Company; provided, however, that no vesting credit will be awarded for the time vesting has been suspended during such leave of absence. A Service Provider will not cease to be an Employee in the case of (i) any leave of absence approved by the Company or (ii) transfers between locations of the Company or between the Company, its Parent, or any Subsidiary. For purposes of Incentive Stock Options, no such leave may exceed ninety (90) days, unless reemployment upon expiration of such leave is guaranteed by statute or contract.

Notwithstanding the preceding, the number of Shares subject to any Award always shall be a whole number.
Adjustments
(b) . In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator will notify each Participant as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction. The Administrator in its discretion may provide for a Participant to have the right to exercise his or her Award, to the extent applicable, until ten (10) days prior to such transaction as to all of the Awarded Stock covered thereby, including Shares as to which the Award would not otherwise be exercisable. In addition, the Administrator may provide that any Company repurchase option or forfeiture rights applicable to any Award shall lapse 100%, and that any Award vesting shall accelerate 100%, provided the proposed dissolution or liquidation takes place at the time and in the manner contemplated.

Dissolution or Liquidation
(c) .
Merger or Change in Control
(i) . In the event of a merger or Change in Control, each outstanding Option and SAR shall be assumed or an equivalent option or SAR substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. With respect to Options and SARs granted to an Outside Director that are assumed or substituted for, if immediately prior to or after the merger or Change in Control the Participant's status as a Director or a director of the successor corporation, as applicable, is terminated other than upon a voluntary resignation by the Participant, then the Participant shall fully vest in and have the right to exercise such Options and SARs as to all of the Awarded Stock, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested or exercisable. Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, in the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Option or SAR, the Participant shall fully vest in and have the right to exercise the Option or SAR as to all of the Awarded Stock, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested or exercisable. If an Option or SAR is not assumed or substituted in the event of a merger or Change in Control, the Administrator shall notify the Participant in writing or electronically that the Option or SAR shall be exercisable, to the extent vested, for a period of up to fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, and the Option or SAR shall terminate upon the expiration of such period. For the purposes of this paragraph, the Option or SAR shall be considered assumed if, following the merger or Change in Control, the option or stock appreciation right confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share of Awarded Stock subject to the Option or SAR immediately prior to the merger or Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the merger or Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the merger or Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of the Option or SAR, for each Share of Awarded Stock subject to the Option or SAR, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or Change in Control. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more performance goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such performance goals without the Participant's consent; provided, however, a modification to such performance goals only to reflect the successor corporation's post-merger or post-Change in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.
Stock Options and SARS
(ii) . In the event of a merger or Change in Control, each outstanding Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award and Restricted Stock Unit awards shall be assumed or an equivalent Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award and Restricted Stock Unit award substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. With respect to Awards granted to an Outside Director that are assumed or substituted for, if immediately prior to or after the merger or Change in Control the Participant's status as a Director or a director of the successor corporation, as applicable, is terminated other than upon a voluntary resignation by the Participant, then the Participant shall fully vest in such Awards, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested. Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, in the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award or Restricted Stock Unit award, the Participant shall fully vest in the Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award or Restricted Stock Unit including as to Shares which would not otherwise be vested. For the purposes of this paragraph, a Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award and Restricted Stock Unit award shall be considered assumed if, following the merger or Change in Control, the award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Award immediately prior to the merger or Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the merger or Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the merger or Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received, for each Share and each unit/right to acquire a Share subject to the Award, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or Change in Control. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more performance goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such performance goals without the Participant's consent; provided, however, a modification to such performance goals only to reflect the successor corporation's post-merger or post-Change in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.
Restricted Stock, Performance Shares, Performance Units, Restricted Stock Units and Other Stock Based Awards
16. . The date of grant of an Award will be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the determination granting such Award, or such other later date as is determined by the Administrator. Notice of the determination will be provided to each Participant within a reasonable time after the date of such grant.
Date of Grant
17. . Subject to Section 22 of the Plan, the Plan will become effective upon its adoption by the Board. It will continue in effect for a term of ten (10) years unless terminated earlier under Section 18 of the Plan.
Term of Plan
18. .

(a) . The Board may at any time amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan.
Amendment and Termination
(b) . The Company will obtain stockholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with Applicable Laws.
Stockholder Approval
(c) . Subject to Section 20 of the Plan, no amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan will impair the rights of any Participant, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Participant and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Participant and the Company. Termination of the Plan will not affect the Administrator's ability to exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to Awards granted under the Plan prior to the date of such termination.
Effect of Amendment or Termination
19. .
Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares
(a) . Shares will not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Award unless the exercise of such Award and the issuance and delivery of such Shares will comply with Applicable Laws and will be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
Legal Compliance
(b) . As a condition to the exercise or receipt of an Award, the Company may require the person exercising or receiving such Award to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise or receipt that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required.
Investment Representations
20. . Notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Plan or an Award to the contrary, if any one or more of the provisions (or any part thereof) of this Plan or the Awards shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such provision shall be modified so as to make it valid, legal and enforceable, and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions (or any part thereof) of the Plan or Award, as applicable, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
Severability
21. . The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, will relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority will not have been obtained.
Inability to Obtain Authority
22. . The Plan will be subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date the Plan is adopted. Such stockholder approval will be obtained in the manner and to the degree required under Applicable Laws.
Stockholder Approval
23. .
Vesting Acceleration of Awards Upon Death
(a) .
Stock Options and SARs
(i) . If a Participant dies while a Service Provider, and at the time of such Participant's death the Participant is not an Officer, all Shares covered by the unvested portion of each outstanding Option and SAR held by the Participant will immediately accelerate upon the Participant's death and become exercisable pursuant to Section 7(d)(iv) hereof.
Non-Officer Participants
(ii) . If a Participant dies while a Service Provider, and at the time of such Participant's death the Participant is an Officer, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of each outstanding Option and SAR held by the Participant as of the Participant's death will immediately revert to the Plan on the date one (1) month following the Participant's death, and the Participant will not be entitled to exercise such Shares pursuant to Section 7(d)(iv) hereof; provided, however, that all Shares covered by the vested portion of the Option or SAR, as applicable, shall remain exercisable pursuant to Section 7(d)(iv) hereof.
Officers
(b) . If a Participant dies while a Service Provider, and at the time of such Participant's death the Participant is not an Officer, then each outstanding Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award or Restricted Stock Unit held by the Participant upon the Participant's death will vest, including as to Shares which would not otherwise be vested, and with respect to such Awards with performance-based vesting, all performance goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at 100% on-target levels and all other terms and conditions met. Participants who are Officers at the time of their death will not be entitled to such accelerated vesting.
Restricted Stock, Performance Shares, Performance Units, Restricted Stock Units and Other Stock Based Awards

Exhibit 99.1
WiFi data collection: An update
Nine days ago the data protection authority (DPA) in Hamburg, Germany asked to audit the WiFi data that our Street View cars collect for use in location-based products like Google Maps for mobile, which enables people to find local restaurants or get directions. His request prompted us to re-examine everything we have been collecting, and during our review we discovered that a statement made in a blog post on April 27 was incorrect.
In that blog post, and in a technical note sent to data protection authorities the same day, we said that while Google did collect publicly broadcast SSID information (the WiFi network name) and MAC addresses (the unique number given to a device like a WiFi router) using Street View cars, we did not collect payload data (information sent over the network). But it's now clear that we have been mistakenly collecting samples of payload data from open (i.e. non-password-protected) WiFi networks, even though we never used that data in any Google products.
However, we will typically have collected only fragments of payload data because: our cars are on the move; someone would need to be using the network as a car passed by; and our in-car WiFi equipment automatically changes channels roughly five times a second. In addition, we did not collect information traveling over secure, password-protected WiFi networks.
So how did this happen? Quite simply, it was a mistake. In 2006 an engineer working on an experimental WiFi project wrote a piece of code that sampled all categories of publicly broadcast WiFi data. A year later, when our mobile team started a project to collect basic WiFi network data like SSID information and MAC addresses using Google's Street View cars, they included that code in their softwarealthough the project leaders did not want, and had no intention of using, payload data.
As soon as we became aware of this problem, we grounded our Street View cars and segregated the data on our network, which we then disconnected to make it inaccessible. We want to delete this data as soon as possible, and are currently reaching out to regulators in the relevant countries about how to quickly dispose of it.
Maintaining people's trust is crucial to everything we do, and in this case we fell short. So we will be:
 
 
In addition, given the concerns raised, we have decided that it's best to stop our Street View cars collecting WiFi network data entirely.
This incident highlights just how publicly accessible open, non-password-protected WiFi networks are today. Earlier this year, we encrypted Gmail for all our users, and next week we will start offering an encrypted version of Google Search. For other services users can check that pages are encrypted by looking to see whether the URL begins with "https", rather than just "http"; browsers will generally show a lock icon when the connection is secure. For more information about how to password-protect your network, read this.
The engineering team at Google works hard to earn your trustand we are acutely aware that we failed badly here. We are profoundly sorry for this error and are determined to learn all the lessons we can from our mistake.

We feel confident about our future, and plan to continue to invest aggressively in our core areas of strategic focus."
Q2 Financial Summary
Google reported revenues of $6.82 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2010, an increase of 24% compared to the second quarter of 2009.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include statements regarding our continued investments in our core areas of strategic focus, our expected stock-based compensation charges, and our plans to make significant capital expenditures. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, unforeseen changes in our hiring patterns and our need to expend capital to accommodate the growth of the business, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, which is on file with the SEC and is available on our investor relations website at investor.google.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2010, which we expect to file with the SEC in July 2010. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of July 15, 2010, and Google undertakes no duty to update this information.
 
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, and free cash flow. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures" and "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow" included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our "recurring core business operating results," meaning our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
 We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income plus stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenues. Google considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of stock-based compensation and one-time events so that Google's management and investors can compare Google's recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under FASB ASC Topic 718, Google's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between Google's recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing Google's management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Google's own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, non-GAAP operating income excludes some costs, namely, stock-based compensation, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Google's business. Second, stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Third, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin.
 
 We define non-GAAP net income as net income plus stock-based compensation less the related tax effects. We define non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average outstanding shares, on a fully-diluted basis. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that Google uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results, we exclude from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS the tax effects associated with stock-based compensation. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results. The same limitations described above regarding Google's use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS together with net income and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP net income and EPS.
. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement and under the caption "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K. Google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include statements regarding our continued investments in our core areas of strategic focus, our expected stock-based compensation charges, and our plans to make significant capital expenditures. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, unforeseen changes in our hiring patterns and our need to expend capital to accommodate the growth of the business, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, which is on file with the SEC and is available on our investor relations website at investor.google.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2010, which we expect to file with the SEC in October 2010. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of October 14, 2010, and Google undertakes no duty to update this information.
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, and free cash flow. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations
measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures" and "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow" included at the end of this release.
 
 
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our "recurring core business operating results," meaning our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
 We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income plus stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenues. Google considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of stock-based compensation so that Google's management and investors can compare Google's recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under ASC Topic 718, Google's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between Google's recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing Google's management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Google's own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, non-GAAP operating income excludes some costs, namely, stock-based compensation, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Google's business. Second, stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Third, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin.
 
 
 We define non-GAAP net income as net income plus stock-based compensation less the related tax effects. We define non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average outstanding shares, on a fully-diluted basis. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that Google uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results, we exclude from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS the tax effects associated with stock-based compensation. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results. The same limitations described above regarding Google's use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS together with net income and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP net income and EPS.
. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement and under the caption "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K. Google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.

In November 2010, Google Ventures invested approximately $3.2 million in the Series C preferred stock financing of 23andMe, Inc., a privately-held personal genetics company dedicated to helping individuals understand their own genetic information through DNA analysis technologies and web-based interactive tools. Google Inc. is the sole limited partner of Google Ventures, and previously invested approximately $3.9 million in the Series A preferred stock financing of 23andMe in May 2007 and approximately $2.6 million in the Series B preferred stock financing of 23andMe in June 2009. In November 2007, Google purchased additional shares of Series A preferred stock of 23andMe held by an investor in 23andMe's Series A preferred stock financing for approximately $500,000. Google Ventures made its investment in the Series C preferred stock financing of 23andMe pursuant to Google's existing right to purchase its pro rata share of new securities issued by 23andMe. Google continues to hold a minority interest in 23andMe as a result of the Series C investment. In June 2009, Google also entered into a lease agreement with 23andMe. The terms and conditions of the lease with 23andMe were reviewed by an independent real estate appraiser.
23andMe's Series C financing involved a number of additional investors, including a new lead investor. Anne Wojcicki, who is a co-founder of 23andMe, and who is also a stockholder and member of its board of directors, is married to Sergey Brin, Google's President, Technology and its co-founder. As of September 30, 2010, Sergey held approximately 39% of Google's Class B common stock. Sergey is also an investor in 23andMe and invested approximately $3.4 million in 23andMe's Series C preferred stock financing.
Google's Audit Committee reviewed and approved Google Ventures' investment in the Series C preferred stock financing of 23andMe as part of Google's procedures for entering into transactions with related parties. The valuation of the Series C investment was determined by negotiations between the new lead investor and 23andMe in which neither Google nor Google Ventures played any role.

On November 8, 2010, the members of the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Google Inc. (LDCC), approved an increase to the annual base salaries (effective as of January 1, 2011) of Google's executive officers, after a review of performance and competitive market data, and as part of a broad-based review of the company's compensation programs. The table below sets forth the annual base salary levels for 2011 and 2010 for Google's current named executive officers:
 
In addition, the LDCC approved an increase in the target bonus percentage from 150% to 250% of base salary for all named executive officers (effective as of January 1, 2011) for purposes of Google's Executive Bonus Plan. Starting in 2011, 50% of the bonus will be based on individual performance and the other 50% on the financial performance of Google. Since 2004, Eric, Larry and Sergey have declined to participate in the Executive Bonus Plan.
 
The LDCC also approved a change to Google's equity granting practice for its executive officers. Going forward, Google generally intends to grant equity awards to executive officers on an annual basis instead of a biannual basis. Since the last equity awards to named executive officers were made in 2009, the LDCC approved the following equity awards for the current named executive officers for calendar year 2010:

On January 20, 2011, Google Inc. ("") is issuing a press release and holding a conference call regarding its financial results for the quarter and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
Google
This information shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
Exchange Act
Google is making reference to non-GAAP financial information in both the press release and the conference call. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures is contained in the attached press release.
 
Google also announced that its Board of Directors had approved certain changes to Google's management team. Larry Page, Google's Co-Founder and President of Products, will become Google's Chief Executive Officer, effective April 4, 2011. Eric Schmidt, Google's current Chief Executive Officer, will continue as the Chairman of the Board of Directors and will serve as Google's Executive Chairman. As Executive Chairman, Eric will continue to act as an advisor to Larry and Sergey and will assist with the transition of the Chief Executive Officer role to Larry. Sergey Brin, Google's Co-Founder and President of Technology, will continue as Google's Co-Founder, focusing on strategic projects. A copy of the blogpost announcing the changes is filed as Exhibit 99.2 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
A copy of the consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of income, and consolidated statements of cash flows for the quarter and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 and other financial tables are filed as Exhibit 99.3 to this Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.
Adoption of Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan
On December 9, 2010, Eric adopted a stock trading plan in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, and Google's Policy Against Insider Trading. In the future, he will begin selling a portion of his Google stock pursuant to this trading plan.
The pre-arranged trading plan was adopted in order to allow Eric to sell a portion of his Google stock as part of his long-term strategy for individual asset diversification and liquidity. The stock transactions pursuant to this trading plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 and Form 144 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Using this trading plan, Eric can diversify his investment portfolio and can spread stock trades out over a period of one year to reduce market impact. Because this trading plan was established well in advance of a trade, it also helps avoid concerns about whether Eric had material, non-public information when he made a decision to sell his stock.
As of December 31, 2010, Eric held approximately 9.2 million shares of Class A and Class B common stock, which represented approximately 2.9% of Google's outstanding capital stock and approximately 9.6% of the voting power of Google's outstanding capital stock. Under the terms of the trading plan, Eric intends to sell approximately 534,000 shares of Class A common stock. If Eric completes all the planned sales under this trading plan, he would continue to own approximately 8.7 million shares, which would represent approximately 2.7% of Google's outstanding capital stock and approximately 9.1% of the voting power of Google's outstanding capital stock (assuming no other sales and conversions of Google capital stock occur).

Commenting on these changes, Eric said: "We've been talking about how best to simplify our management structure and speed up decision making for a long time. By clarifying our individual roles we'll create clearer responsibility and accountability at the top of the company. In my clear opinion, Larry is ready to lead and I'm excited about working with both him and Sergey for a long time to come."
Larry said: "Eric has clearly done an outstanding job leading Google for the last decade. The results speak for themselves. There is no other CEO in the world that could have kept such headstrong founders so deeply involved and still run the business so brilliantly. Eric is a tremendous leader and I have learned innumerable lessons from him. His advice and efforts will be invaluable to me as I start in this new role. Google still has such incredible opportunity  we are only at the beginning and I can't wait to get started."

ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, and free cash flow. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures" and "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow" included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our "recurring core business operating results," meaning our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
 
 We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income plus stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenues. Google considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of stock-based compensation so that Google's management and investors can compare Google's recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under ASC Topic 718, Google's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between Google's recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing Google's management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Google's own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, non-GAAP operating income excludes some costs, namely, stock-based compensation, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Google's business. Second, stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Third, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin.
 We define non-GAAP net income as net income plus stock-based compensation less the related tax effects. We define non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average outstanding shares, on a fully-diluted basis. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that Google uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results, we exclude from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS the tax effects associated with stock-based compensation. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results. The same limitations described above regarding Google's use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS together with net income and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP net income and EPS.
 
. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement and under the caption "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K. Google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.

Exhibit 99.2
AN UPDATE FROM THE CHAIRMAN
When I joined Google in 2001 I never imaginedeven in my wildest dreamsthat we would get as far, as fast as we have today. Search has quite literally changed people's livesincreasing the collective sum of the world's knowledge and revolutionizing advertising in the process. And our emerging businessesdisplay, Android, YouTube and Chromeare on fire. Of course, like any successful organization we've had our fair share of good luck, but the entire teamnow over 24,000 Googlers globallydeserves most of the credit.
And as our results today show, the outlook is . But as Google has grown, managing the business has become more complicated. So Larry, Sergey and I have been talking for a long time how best to simplify our management structure and speed up decision makingand over the holidays we decided now was the right moment to make some changes to the way we are structured.
bright
For the last 10 years, we have all been equally involved in making decisions. This triumvirate approach has real benefits in terms of shared wisdom, and we will continue to discuss the big decisions among the three of us. But we have also agreed to clarify our individual roles so there's clear responsibility and accountability at the top of the company.
Larry will now lead our product development and technology strategy, his greatest strengths, and starting from April 4 he will take charge of our day-to-day operations as Google's Chief Executive Officer. In this new role I know he will merge Google's technology and business vision brilliantly. I am enormously proud of my last decade as CEO, and I am certain that the next 10 years under Larry will be even better! Larry, in my clear opinion, is ready to lead.
Sergey has decided to devote his time and energy to strategic projects, in particular working on new products. His title will be co-founder. He's an innovator and entrepreneur to the core, and this role suits him perfectly.
As Executive Chairman, I will focus wherever I can add the greatest value: externally, on the deals, partnerships, customers and broader business relationships, government outreach and technology thought leadership that are increasingly important given Google's global reach; and internally as an advisor to Larry and Sergey.
We are confident that this focus will serve Google and our users well in the future. Larry, Sergey and I have worked exceptionally closely together for over a decadeand we anticipate working together for a long time to come. As friends, co-workers and computer scientists we have a lot in common, most important of all a profound belief in the potential for technology to make the world a better place. We love Googleour people, our products and most of all the opportunity we have to improve the lives of millions of people around the world.

Operator
Good day and welcome, everyone, to the Google Inc. fourth-quarter 2010 earnings conference call. This call is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Jane Penner, Senior IR Manager. Please go ahead.
>>Jane Penner
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to today's fourth-quarter and fiscal year 2010 earnings conference call. With us are Eric Schmidt, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board; Larry Page, co-Founder and President, Products; Sergey Brin, co-Founder and President, Technology; Patrick Pichette, Chief Financial Officer; Jonathan Rosenberg, Senior Vice President, Product Management; and Nikesh Arora, Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer.
This call is also being webcast from investor.google.com. A replay of the call will be available on our website in a few hours. Now let me quickly cover the Safe Harbor.
Some of the statements we make today may be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding our accepted level of capital expenditures, Google's future and investments in our long-term growth and innovation, and the expected performance of our business. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only of the date of this presentation, and we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results.
Please note that certain financial measures we use on this call such as operating income and operating margin are also expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation. We have also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Eric.
>>Eric Schmidt
Thank you very much, Jane, and thanks, everybody, for getting on our call. Your time is very valuable. I'm really glad that you all could join us for our quarterly call as reasonably scheduled. We have jumped on the call to talk about the other announcement of this afternoon, which I think everybody is getting a chance to read.
We have had a very strong quarter and a very strong year, and I think, as our results show today, our outlook is very, very bright. Larry and Sergey and I spend a lot of time talking about how to run everything. The last decade, of course, has been fantastic, and we anticipate this will continue. How can we run the Company even better? And just after a long series of conversations, we decided to make some changes in the way we are structuring, the way we actually operate things.
Historically we have always been running the decisions together, and ultimately it adds delay and so forth in the way we make decisions. It is actually better to clarify it. So the proposal, which we have ultimately now, the Board has completely approved is by elevating me and having Larry running things day-to-day, Sergey focusing on the area that he is going to talk about, we think this has will produce even better success for the corporation. And, of course, we are going to do all of this by April.
So Larry, do you want to introduce a little bit about your thoughts?
 
>>Larry Page
Well, first, I want to really congratulate Eric. He has done an outstanding job leading Google for the last decade. I don't think when Sergey and I started the Company, we would have imagined  we could have possibly imagined we would have a better leader for the Company, and we are all in great debt to Eric. And I think the results really speak for themselves. There is no debate about that at all.
And there is really no one else in the universe that could have accomplished what Eric has done. And Eric is really a tremendous leader, and I have learned a ton from him over the years. And I think his advice and efforts going forward as Executive Chairman will be invaluable to me and to the Company as I start this new role.
Google I want to say is just an incredible opportunity. When we started Google, people actually thought we were coming in too late. There were already a lot of other search engines. And the Internet and really people's computing life is really still at the very early stages, and I cannot be more excited about moving us forward, and we are really only at the beginning. I just can't wait to get us started.
>>Eric Schmidt
Thank you, Larry. Sergey, do you want to talk a little bit about what you would like to get done in this new structure?
>>Sergey Brin
I would like to first at the outset mention that I have had a great time working together with Larry now for about 15 years and with Eric for about a decade. And both of them have really inspired me and moved me, and I'm looking forward to many more decades of work together.
Now, as we have tried to clarify our respective roles, now I would like to work more on my personal passions, which corresponds of several significant new products that I hope to tell you about in the future. I'm not going to  I know we have been accused of vaporware just recently in the press and whatnot. So I don't want to repeat that error, and I hope to tell you about them in the future when I'm ready to show you something.
But nonetheless it is really a privilege to work with these two gentlemen to continue to work with them and at this company that I have been really proud to be a part of all this time.
>>Eric Schmidt
Thank you very much. And as for myself, I'm going to get a chance to work on the things that I am most interested in, taking a more strategic view of things. And I'm going to focus on customers, partners, various government communications, external issues more than the internal issues that I have historically been focusing on. So that is a significant, I think, improvement in the kind of things that I can do with my time.
And I want to say very clearly that I believe Larry is ready. He has been working on this area for a long time. His ideas are very interesting and clever, and it is time for him to have a shot at running this and doing it, and I'm sure he will do a fantastic job.
It is interesting that a decade goes by very fast when you work in a partnership as wonderful as this has been, and I'm quite sure that this partnership will continue. We are friends. We are coworkers. We are computer scientists. We have a common vision. I don't anticipate any material change in any of our strategies or anything. We tend to agree on pretty much everything. But I do believe that as a result of this, we will operate and execute the business even better.
So with that, I thought may be what we should do is have a few questions before we rush off, and then, Patrick, thank you so much for accommodating us on to your call.
 
>>Patrick Pichette
It is our pleasure. Jay, if you don't mind, what we will do is we will set up two sets of questions for this afternoon. We will just take a few questions now because we have Larry, Sergey and Eric, and so we will take a few questions. And then after that, we will close that section of the call, let them run back  go back to work, guys  and then we will take the regular call as we usually proceed. So, Jay, if I can ask you to give us the instructions to take a couple of questions for Eric, Larry and Sergey.
Operator
(Operator Instructions). James Mitchell, Goldman Sachs.
>>James Mitchell
Congratulations on the movements, and congratulations on the results. I guess one question I had just stemming from the results rather than from the movements perhaps is when I look at the investments in 111 8th Avenue in New York City, do you feel that Google is now at a point where in order to continue facilitating the growth of the Internet that there will be a land grab for desirable physical locations?
>>Larry Page
I think our primary reason for purchasing the building there was not the Internet structure there, but rather the office space that we really enjoy using. The Internet tenants are great, well-paying tenants. We appreciate having them there. But that is not the primary reason why we purchased the building.
Operator
Spencer Wang, Credit Suisse.
>>Spencer Wang
Just the big picture questions for Eric. You mentioned that one of your areas of focus will be on government outreach, and it seems like Google has may be come under a little bit more regulatory scrutiny over the past several years. So I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about your strategy with regulators to just ensure that Google can continue to expand as necessary?
>>Eric Schmidt
The simple answer is that we are talking to them. An awful lot of the problems that we have been having are people don't actually understand what we really do, and what we don't do and some of our competitors are assisting in that misinformation.
And so part of our core strategy is literally to communicate. So what we are doing is we're trying to be as transparent and collaborative as possible.
I would tell you very clearly that the regulators have a proper job to do. They are there for a reason, and we respect that. And so far we have been quite successful by just taking the time to get people to understand, and we are sensitive to the close lines where we get too close to something, and we try to stay away from that. So we try to stay well within the safety zone of the way we are operating with respect to the legal issues and the competitive issues. We also argue very strongly that the things we are doing are very pro-competitive, and I genuinely believe that, and I will be telling people a lot of that for a long time I suspect.
Operator
Imran Khan, JPMorgan.
>>Imran Khan
Congratulations to everybody. A quick question. Larry, as you become the CEO, I think, which is a very interesting juncture of Google's lifecycle and I think there is a lot of questions that we get from investors that the proliferation of social networking and how the traffic  more and more traffic the social networking platforms are becoming. So, as Google gets to the next level, how do you think about the real-time search and the social networking platforms becoming (inaudible) and the Web applications and the mobile apps? How do you think Google becomes the point of place that you can send traffic to other places?
 
>>Eric Schmidt
Sergey, you have been driving most of this, and may be Larry, you comment as well.
>>Sergey Brin
Yes, I think you pointed out two important trends, I think. One is the notion of real-time, and the other is the broad notion of social in terms of identity relationships and so forth. And I think both of those are very important to search. In fact, you have seen over the past year or so us roll out functionality along those lines.
First of all, of course, we have the real-time updates now built into our search, which includes Twitter and other sources. You have also seen us deploy Social Search, which allows you to find search results that are related to people who you know and friends of their friends and so forth, and you see those right in the main search results of the Web.
But I think this is really just the tip of the iceberg, and I think there is far more opportunity. We have touched just 1% of the capabilities that could be deployed in that realm, and I think you should expect us to continue to develop those kind of capabilities.
>>Eric Schmidt
Larry, did you want to add anything to that?
>>Larry Page
I mean the last part of what Sergey said really resonates with me. I think that there is  if you think about the next five years of what your life will be like online socially and what kind of things the tools will be able to do, we are only at the very, very early stages of that, and I'm incredibly excited about the possibilities.
>>Eric Schmidt
Thank you. I think we have time for one more question, and I will just have a final comment.
Operator
Justin Post, Bank of America.
>>Justin Post
We have noticed a lot of changes on the site moving you farther down the purchasing funnel, and we've heard some regulatory pushbacks  so may be this is a question for you, Eric  but also potential some advertiser complaints. So I was just wondering how the changes in your search ad results, are they really driving your revenues and helping drive the strong growth and how are you dealing with advertisers in the regulatory environment on some of those changes that might be replacing some of the functionality of other websites?
>>Eric Schmidt
There is no question that our extraordinary results are partly coming from algorithmic improvements that we do all the time. Our basic strategy, of course, is to have the right ad in the right spot done exactly right every time, and we do literally billions of these everyday. And so that is the great magic of Google, if you will.
We have looked very, very carefully at how we make the decisions as to which ads go where and so forth, and we are pretty happy with the choice that we have made in terms of ranking ads and so forth. There have been some competitor complaints and so forth of that, and we have done a pretty thorough review. But so far we are pretty happy with it, and we think it will pass the necessary complaints and so forth that people are hearing.
 
>>Eric Schmidt
So I think with that, I think we have sort of run  Patrick is saying we have really run over our time. I really appreciate everybody sort of letting us come in and do this.
I wanted to say to you that it has been a great privilege to be the CEO for 10 years, literally a decade, and a decade is a long time to be a CEO. So I'm very much looking forward to this new role, more strategic role and something where I can work on some new things which I'm excited about. And I'm even more looking forward to working with my literally best friends and partners, Larry and Sergey, and I hope you all understand how powerful this (inaudible) has been and how for us personally and how much it means to us as individuals.
So thank you all, and Patrick, do you want to just sort of takeover?
>>Patrick Pichette
Absolutely. Thank you so much, Larry, Sergey, Eric, to take the time to join us this afternoon. So with that, what we will do is we are going to jump right into it, and we will go to our more regular conversation. So I will start with my opening remarks on the financials. Jonathan is going to give us his read of the year, and then we will be joined by Nikesh for our Q&A section.
So how else to talk about 2010 and Q4 as a phenomenal ending to a very good year at Google. I mean our incredibly strong performance in Q4 and 2010 overall is really a testimonial to the fundamental trends in the digital economy. Those trends they are fueling huge opportunities for innovation, for growth both at Google, but also in the entire ecosystem.
One of these profound trends is the shift from advertising off-line to online, and it continues at quite a rapid clip. And you have seen it fueling growth both in our core search business, but across the board as well. A case in point is revenue growth is in our core accelerated strongly in the second half of 2010, which is really particularly impressive if you think about it, given that in Q4 2009 was itself a very strong quarter.
In additions, investments in our newer businesses, the usual suspects of display, mobile, enterprise, they are also in parallel creating a second powerful growth engine for Google. Jonathan will give you more details on that in a minute. But at a high level, I just want to make it clear that how can we not be happy with the overall performance and trajectories of 2010 and on that basis be excited about our prospects for 2011 and beyond?
So let me turn for the specifics of the performance of the quarter now. Let's go through our results.
Gross revenue, we grew 26% year over year to $8.4 billion. Our Google websites revenue was up 28% year over year to $5.7 billion, and we saw strength across most major geographies and verticals. Our AdSense revenue was up 22% year over year to $2.5 billion, again with continued strength in our Google Display Network. Our other revenue was up 31% to $273 million. Our global aggregate paid click growth was very strong, up 18% year over year and up 11% quarter over quarter. This is really reflecting, as I mentioned, the accelerating shift of off-line to online. Without a doubt, as each year shows, there is more and more holiday shopping happening online. Our aggregate cost per click growth also was pretty healthy up 5% year over year and 4% quarter over quarter. And note that FX had a negative impact on CPC growth year over year although a positive impact quarter over quarter. Remember, too, that this is an aggregate number, and that includes the dot-com and AdSense properties.
If I turn to our geographic performance, the US and the rest of the world are both growing at a very healthy pace, and our results clearly show that. While the UK continued to lag a little bit in the global economic recovery, revenue from the US was up just shy of 30% at 29% to $4.1 billion. And in our earnings slides that you can find on our investor website, you will see that we have broken down our revenue by US, UK and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits from our hedging program. So I encourage you to go to these slides for the exact calculations.
The international revenue accounted for 52% of our revenue up  or sorry, $4.4 billion and up 25% year over year. And it includes $25 million of benefits from our hedging program, so a relatively small number. Using fixed exchange rates, though, our international revenue would have been roughly $132 million higher year over year. As I said, the UK was a little slower, and it was up 14% year over year to $878 million.
 
If I turn to expenses, traffic acquisition costs at $2.1 billion or 25% of advertising revenue. Other cost of revenue was $877 million, including stock-based compensation of $45 million. And finally, all operating expenses totaled $2.5 billion, including approximately $351 million in stock-based compensation.
The increase year over year in OpEx was primarily due to our increases in payroll, advertising and promotion spend and professional services. As a result of all of this, our non-GAAP operating profit, which excludes our stock-based compensation, increased to $3.4 billion in Q4, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 40%. Our headcount was up approximately 1000 for the quarter, and we ended the year roughly at 24,400 full-time employees.
Our effective tax rate you should note was 19% in Q4, and this reflects the R&D tax credit legislation that passed in December in the US and for which we recognized a full benefit in Q4.
Now let me turn to cash management. OI&E was $160 million per Q4, which reflects the continued good portfolio management performance, and that was offset a little bit by our FAS 133 expenses. For more detail, again, on OI&E, I would just encourage you to refer to the slides of the Company, this call and our IR site. Our operating cash flow was very strong at $3.5 billion for the quarter. CapEx for the fourth quarter was $2.5 billion. I mean obviously significantly above the last quarter, but remember that the majority of this increase was from the purchase of the New York building.
The remaining balance was as usual primarily related to our datacenter and operations. As a reminder, we will continue to make significant CapEx investments, and yet you have another data point to show that they do tend to be lumpy from quarter to quarter depending on when we are able to make these investments.
We are very pleased with our free cash flow, despite having purchased the office building in New York just shy of $1 billion, and the office building is obviously a one-time event.
So, with all this being said, Google is in an excellent financial performance for 2010 with incremental revenue for the year of $5.7 billion and operating cash flow around $11 billion. That is a phenomenal performance. Plus, a digital economy that is clearly on high gear. So why in that context you can understand why we are so optimistic, and it is with confidence that we are pursuing an aggressive growth agenda.
We talk about growth agenda means investing. So here's a couple of places where we have decided to invest and will continue to invest. First, we talked about the intense competition, if you remember on our last call, for labor. So, as part of the strategy to answer this challenge, we have announced a compensation change in Q4, which will affect all of our employees. We have made two changes to attract and retain the best talent.
First, we raised all base salaries by 10% across the board. In addition to that, we shifted some compensation from bonus into base salary for non-execs  and I repeat for non-execs  which is  which will result for them in more stable income for our employees. And please note that all those changes are really becoming effective on January 1 of this year, so they are not included into our Q4 results.
Remember, also, that with salary increases come ripple effects such as 401(k)s or employee taxes or other that will actually flow through as well. So if that is for compensation, we have also made and continue to make strategic investments in sales and marketing for both new products but also advertiser acquisition. Product areas like Chrome and Chrome OS, which are such a part of our future, follow our core philosophy of building these open platforms with big optionality and creating infrastructure where everybody on the Web can succeed. We will continue to push on those. But also acquiring advertisers will and continues to remain a top priority.
We are also investing in our long-term infrastructure, including both facilities and our core computing network. As you have seen in Q4, the purchase of the New York City office was not only a wise investment, but a clear commitment to our New York City site and, frankly, a reflection of our optimism about our growth prospects.
Investing in innovation is also about making tough choices, and we have made them throughout 2010 as well by choosing to close products or initiatives that were not working as well as we would have liked or just had run their courses. So, for examples, we did shut down the Wave product, and we have also shut down our consumer channel
 
for Nexus in 2010, and also many other smaller projects that we would not talk usually on the call, but things like GOOG-411. And yes, we are investing aggressively but with discipline. Really, as we mentioned in the last call, pouring a lot of resources on what we call our hockey sticks with a clear focus on long-term ROI. And yes, we will continue to invest heavily, but with the same proven discipline and results that you have witnessed from us over the last few years.
So, in summary, we are incredibly pleased with our performance in 2010, optimistic about our trajectory for 2011 and beyond. Accordingly we continue to invest aggressively in a bold innovation agenda.
So with that, I will turn it over to Jonathan to speak about the product milestones in Q4 and 2010, and then we will take it over to Q&A. Jonathan, all yours.
>>Jonathan Rosenberg
Okay. Well, thanks, Patrick.
So we certainly did have a great year at Google, and I would really like to think some of it stems from the unique way that we manage our product and engineering machine. When we hire product managers, they often come in and they ask me, they say, so how do we measure success at Google? And I always tell them it is simple. At the end of the year, we make a list of all of your successes and your failures. You are then measured on the sum of your successes and by how much you learn from your failures.
So, at the beginning of 2010, one of our concerns was that as we scaled, this approach might lead to our being spread too thin. Instead we thought may be we needed to put more wood behind fewer arrows. So we made some changes. And I think they address this concern without actually affecting the basic philosophy of how we have always run product engineering at Google.
So let's talk about what we changed. At the beginning of the year, we decided to double down on the core. So that is search and search ads, and I think the financial numbers that you guys are seeing today reflect the fact that that was a success bet.
But behind those numbers is a really relentless stream of new features and product innovations. For example, we made a big effort this year to make search more interactive, and you can see that with Google Instant. And then more recently, we made the previews instant as well. And earlier in the year, we launched new user interfaces for both Web search and image search to make it easier and to make it more intuitive to work with the results after you run a search. And we are also making search more intelligent. We made several changes to results. So now you can see things like a concert schedule or the answers to the questions highlighted right in the snippet.
And we are also now starting to roll out place search. So when we know that you're looking for something that is in the neighborhood like an ice cream shop or something, we will pull reviews, webpages, the address and a photo altogether for you. We also double down on the ad side of the house. In the past year, we have launched several new ad formats which we have told you about  site links, seller rating ads. Recently we just added this product listing ads with photos and prices. It makes sense that if I'm shopping for something like a coffee maker, it is helpful to see more information in the ad.
But the biggest boost of all came from good old-fashioned ad quality improvements. Q4 was our best quarter in years from a quality standpoint. We launched over 20 updates, which led to gains that were nearly double those that we would normally see in a strong quarter.
So although we have been at this for years, we are still finding lots and lots of ways to make ads better.
The other change in 2010 was that several of our new businesses started to achieve escape velocity. And our philosophy is to encourage lots of innovation, and then we feed the winners and starve the losers. And this creates kind of a Darwinian but sort of Googley environment in which new businesses emerge and grow, and in 2010 it is really clear that some new winners started to emerge.
 
Like display, we now have over 2 million publisher partners. The number of transactions on the DoubleClick Ad Exchange tripled, and publishers who sell their ad space via the exchange are nearly tripling their revenue when the exchange wins the auction. YouTube revenue more than doubled. We began adding features like live streaming to help partners deliver and ultimately, of course, to monetize content in new ways. Enterprise added impressive customers like the US government's General Services Administration, and we expanded distribution with partnerships like the deal with Softbank in Japan; Android, now activating over 300,000 phones per day. This helped drive a 10X year-over-year increase in the volume of searches from Android devices.
Then finally, in 2010 I think we were more structured in our approach to our business. The product and sales teams are working together more closely than ever, thanks in large part to my buddy here, Nikesh. Patrick's rigor helped us dynamically reallocate resources and, as he mentioned, cancel a few projects, like Wave and Nexus One direct to consumer that were not achieving their goals.
So what does all this mean for 2011? I think you can expect more of the same. We are going to double down again on the core of search and search ads. We are going to feed the 2010 winners  display, YouTube, enterprise and Android  and we are going to do it all with even greater financial rigor and cross-functional coordination all over the world.
But I'm also excited about the prospect for a couple of our newest businesses, local and commerce. In local, over 5 million businesses have claimed their Google place pages, and we recently started testing a new ad product, which we call Boost, and that gives businesses a really easy and fast way to promote themselves online and to connect with the people who are searching for them.
In commerce we are investing a lot to close the loop from online to off-line shopping. I think I have mentioned on four different earnings calls in the past couple of years the key to unlocking mobile commerce was to make it easier for people to both search and then to consummate their transaction from their mobile device. Someone on my team actually counted back on the calls, and it was four times. I think as smartphones become ubiquitous and local businesses put their inventory online, I think this is the year where phones will play the big rolling commerce that I have long predicted.
There will be some important differences in 2011. We will invest in hiring even more product managers and engineers. We are going to give them greater autonomy, and we are going to push them to work faster. In fact, we are asking everyone here to do more and to do it faster.
Through the year, we will tally our successes. I'm sure you all will probably remind us of any failures so we can keep learning from them. I hope you all now better understand our sense of optimism from a product perspective for 2011. I'm confident you guys will help us keep track of how this year's product efforts play out on the important scorecard of financial progress.
Thanks a lot and back to Patrick.

Thank you, Jonathan. Now Jonathan and I have made a nobel attempt on the back of the big announcement of today to keep your attention over the last 10 minutes. So I hope that you will have taken all the notes that you had to. And now what we will do is we will turn it to Jay. Nikesh is joining us, so he is getting set up in his chair with his phone, and we will turn it over to Jay, and we will go through the Q&A section of this call.
Jay, give us the instructions, please.

Congratulations on the quarter and the year. Jonathan, I want to ask you a question about mobile and specifically how Google thinks about the differences between tablet users and smartphone users and how those differences are really influencing the high-level view of how you are viewing the overall evolving mobile market? And then Patrick, if you could just address the sales and marketing line, which I think was somewhat unexpectedly high? Thanks.
>>Jonathan Rosenberg
Sure. We can take that in order. I will go with the first question. I think it is probably easier to talk about initially how tablets and smartphones are similar. Right? Both of them are growing at a terrific pace. As is the case with mobile, what we see on these devices is that search usage on the tablets tends to peak on the weekends, and it dips on the weekdays. So it is generally complementary to desktop, which we have talked about before. What does that suggest? May be that people are using them more for personal usage as opposed to business.
We do see on tablets the weekend peak is a little bit more pronounced than it is on phones. I think that is probably the case because people pretty much always carry their smartphone during the week. Some of the bigger differences, the tablet users tend to search more for things like news, and they tend to do more shopping-related topics when you compare them to smartphone users. I think there is some anecdotal data that they may convert better, but I have not actually been through all of that in detail. I tend to think that the tablets behave a little bit more like desktop devices than do smartphones because it is a little easier to input information into them like a credit card.
I think the other major difference is the UI approaches are different, apps. Like the Gmail app for the tablet is more designed for the big screen. So I think they are both taking off, and the revenue from tablets, as well as smartphones, reflects that. Patrick?
>>Patrick Pichette
Alright. I will take the second question. If there is a good proof that we just don't kind of like streamline our lines in terms of expenses but we go opportunistically in a smart move, I think sales and marketing is a great example of that. And then if you think of the last 12 months, what we have clearly shown is how much in high yield is the digital economy?
And when that opportunity shows up, we just needed to jump on it and decide to fuel it. And on the marketing side and even on sales, I mean I will ask Nikesh to give you a bit of color on the sales side. But, on the marketing side, when you have big platforms like Chrome and Chrome OS that can and will be incredibly successful if promoted, why wouldn't you do it now? Why  I hear from the financial community, the other side, which is, what are you doing with your money? Well, we have great opportunities. Why wouldn't we jump on it with this kind of market? And on the sales side, Nikesh, you could probably give a color commentary as well.
>>Nikesh Arora
Thank you, Patrick. Hi, guys. I think what is important here to understand, we decided to put our foot to the pedal last year. And there was an area of our customers that advertised we decided to continue to put more focus on, which is the small to medium-sized advertisers. Because that is where a lot of our growth engine is going to come from in the future. And effectively a lot of the sales costs there are advertiser acquisition costs. Because as long as we bring them into our system, they stay there for a while, and they continue to work with us and continue to generate more revenues. And some of the revenue performance you are seeing has been across the small channels, the mid-tier channels, and that investment is already beginning to bear fruit.

If I can ask a question on the local advertising play, it sounds like you have got a couple of products you have been working on rolling out for a while. I think you also may have attempted an acquisition intra-quarter. Can you may be quantify the opportunity for us? Is this something that has always been a part of the buildup plan? Is there something you saw in the last 12 months that really indicated that this was the time to accelerate the efforts against local advertising? And then do you already feel like you have got all the assets now in place, or are you still going to look for more assets in order to have that play viable?
 
>>Patrick Pichette
Let me just, as a preamble, we do not talk about M&A. Local has always been part of our strategy. And Nikesh can talk about the initiatives or just about the initiatives we are doing there in terms of the boost in the products that you have or may be, Jonathan, the Boost products. And just it is one more of the initiatives we have in local. But local is just to kind of give a sense of framework. It is one out of every five searches have some form of local kind of tendency or factor. So it is not kind of a side event for us. Jonathan?
>>Jonathan Rosenberg
Sure. I think we have been very focused on local since going all the way back to may be my second year when we acquired Keyhole here with Google, which was basically the original company that built Google Earth. And really the idea was that ultimately the Web should be this virtual mirror of the world at all times. And that mirror of the world becomes much more useful when it is more relevant, and it is more relevant to the users when you get everything organized around places in the physical world.
And I think the other thing which has come into play more recently is that technology has made it possible through the use of GPS and smartphones for us to understand where you are. And so I think what we have recognized more recently is that because smartphones have become deployed more aggressively, that we can supply you with relevant information about the places that you are near with the appropriate contextual-oriented search. So if you're at a restaurant, you want to pull up a menu. You don't want just the menu that the waiter handed you. You want the one in there that has the reviews and the picks from your friends.
So I think what has basically changed over the course of the last year is it has become easier for local businesses to identify themselves in context on Google, and it has become easier for us to find out where you are. And then, of course, we have mapped that with Nikesh's team, which is working on selling Boost and tags and some of the other ad formats that we have developed specifically for local.
Operator
Doug Anmuth, Barclays Capital.
>>Doug Anmuth
Patrick, can you talk a little bit more about your thoughts simply just around the New York headquarters? I think this is the first time where you have actually really come out and confirmed the purchase. And why do you need to own the New York headquarters rather than getting access to it in some other way? And why is this a good use of capital?
And then secondly, can you just talk just following up on local, discuss whether you really are building out more of a local salesforce in addition to obviously the local products themselves?
>>Patrick Pichette
I will take the first, and then I will let Nikesh talk about the initiatives we are doing on the local side. We have 2000 employees on-site today in New York. And our business and our engineering center  it is a big engineering center, by the way, not only a big kind of sales center, but it is a big engineering center.
So if you think of the Eastern hub being that place, with 2000 and growing at the pace at which we are growing, it is actually very difficult to find in New York a place that would accommodate that number of employees in an environment that fits Google's standards and Google's needs. We do not  I mean we actually believe that living in a tower where there is a very small footprint on a floor to floor is terrible for the Google culture.
 
So there's very few buildings in New York that actually can accommodate our needs. Replacing that building for us or moving out of there would actually be probably very difficult to find another place and then be prohibitively expensive.
And then finally, it gives us a lot of control over growing into that space. So all of this to say on top of what we believe will be  is a very good investment. So for all these reasons, coming back to the previous, it is not about carrier hotel owning. It really is about the Googleyness. So for all these reasons, I think it did make sense, and we called it a one-time item because it just fitted so well our strategy.
For the local salesforce, I will turn it to Nikesh to give you a bit more details on our strategy.
>>Nikesh Arora
I think it is important to understand that local the way you define it actually ends up in three different interpretations. One is we always had local features to our AdWords products. You can always localize your advertising towards users who are in certain areas, certain territories. So you always had the ability to localize.
The other thing we have done in local is the way I think local is sometimes synonymous with smaller advertisers and smaller territories. And towards that end, we have created a more simplistic set of products around Tags and Boost, which is more and more able to those advertisers, they don't have to do a lot of work. Sometimes they don't even have their own website, and that allows them to still participate in the online economy.
And the third is that we have for the longest of times had partnerships with other companies who have been selling advertising on our behalf to smaller advertisers, be it in small, local areas, or we have been using other partners who will use their salesforce. It has brought on smaller advertisers for us. So we are going to use a combination of all these three efforts to continue to pursue our local strategy going forward.

Brian Pitz, UBS.
>>Brian Pitz
Patrick, would you give us a rough organic revenue growth rate, excluding acquisitions? And then secondly, a question on ads. Are you guys seeing any competitive share shifts in dollars from search or display towards other social platforms or applications?
>>Patrick Pichette
So on the second one, I will let Nikesh give you a sense. On the first one, I don't have the breakdown. We don't provide the breakdown. But I can tell you that all of our core properties are growing very well. And not only our core properties, but also our new growth businesses as well. When you look at the numbers for just the Google.com growing year over year, 28%, how can you not be happy with that kind of performance? And so overall we are very pleased with our growth rate of revenue. I will let Nikesh talk about the second piece.
>>Nikesh Arora
I think it is important to understand that search for the longest of times has been performance advertising, and so has a large chunk of display been performance advertising. So the newer players you are talking about are sort playing the brand display space. So overall, if you look at it, the stronger trend is shift of brand dollars from the off-line world into the online world, and can you shift some of those dollars, sales and marketing dollars, into performance-based advertising? So we are seeing that shift both on our search side, we are seeing that shift on our display side, but also seeing some brand dollars on the search side and some brand dollars on the display side.
So I think it is more than fair to say that right now the bigger trend is the shift from off-line to online, and there has been less of an allocation of shift within the online world. Because all these measures, all these means are measurable, and you are seeing better ROI for these measurable events in both on-performance display and performance search. So that is what the trend is.
 
Operator
Ross Sandler, RBC Capital Markets.
>>Ross Sandler
Two questions. First, Patrick, a question on the display business. If you look out and analyze the financial statements for just about any publicly traded ad network out there, these businesses seem to peak out and the operating margins seem to peak out in the 20% to 25% range. Do you think there is anything structurally different about Google's approach in the display business that could allow Google to achieve higher operating margins, or is that just the peak for that kind of business model?
And then, Nikesh, just a quick question on the ROW acceleration. So 31% year over year. Can you talk a little bit about which regions that is coming from, or is it across the board, and is there any acceleration from new revenue areas like display, or is it just the core search business?
>>Patrick Pichette
On the first one, let me answer the display, and then I will let Nikesh talk about the performance worldwide.
I think in display the most fundamental issue is, if you are on your own network or if you're optimizing for other's network and participating in others network. So if you think of YouTube, it is our own property, and therefore, you have a completely different set of economics. And so you just got to make sure you don't compare apples and oranges. So one obviously has a much higher margin than the other. And the question then is the mix. So if you think of us in display where we have the whole suite of services from what used to be Teracent and all the other pieces, then you have the mix of properties, and that is how you have to think about it.
In terms of geographic split and performance, I will let  it is a fantastic story. So why don't I let Nikesh give you the color commentary on it.
>>Nikesh Arora
Just before this adding to what Patrick said on the display side, I think it is also important to understand the contribution of the Ad Exchange. It basically allows you to bring buyers and sellers together, and we are seeing a serious uplift for people who are participating on the Ad Exchange in terms of revenues.
So, you know, whilst your traditional display business you might be seeing margin profiles are different  and I cannot predict future margin profiles  but clearly there is an uplift and a benefit to advertisers who participate in the exchange. So that has also been beneficial.
>>Patrick Pichette
Put it differently, we have three sources, Nikesh, because you have to add the Ad Exchange on top.
>>Nikesh Arora
Yes. So, in terms of the sort of rest of the world performance, I think there are some things notable this quarter in addition to our usual stalwarts where the US continues to be strong and the rest of the world is strong. Germany has maintained its strength because of its economic development, which has been different from the rest of Europe. So that has showed up in our results as well. I'm very particularly excited about some of the turnaround we have achieved in Japan because we have been putting in a concerted effort over the last many months to try and put an aggressive foot out in the marketplace in terms of bringing in more partners, more advertisers and generally upgrading the entire effort in Japan from our side. So we are seeing the results of that.
In addition to that, some of the commodity markets, markets where commodities are strong  Brazil, Australia, some of those  have been strong in general. The UK continues to be weak, as you noticed. But that is a very strong market for us; it is a big market for us as well.
 
>>Patrick Pichette
In closing on that topic, I think it is worth noting, if you do your financial math and you move rest of world into constant FX, so if you take out the fact that we add crosswinds year over year, in fact, our growth rate for rest of world is over 30%. It is 31%. So, again, very good momentum there.
Operator
Scott Devitt, Morgan Stanley.
>>Scott Devitt
Paid click growth on a percentage basis was the highest rate in two years. You mentioned a few things on the call  better ads, better targeting, even local monetization. I was just wondering to what extent some other factors came into play as well, particularly Google instant and the rollout of that product, as well as the incremental nature of smartphone and tablet queries?
>>Patrick Pichette
Okay. So I think that for paid click growth, you really have to look at a couple of factors. I just want to start by debunking a myth on Google Instant. Everybody seems to have  there is kind of a buzz out there that Google Instant is the driver for a lot of the revenue growth. And, in fact, Google Instant is neutral. It is not making any significant contribution to our revenue growth.
What is really making the contribution is that there is really our growth is driven by three interdependent drivers that are all acting and fielding together. One is clearly the strength of the economic recovery and the consumer shift online. And you can look ever since Thanksgiving and you have seen it from external sources as well, people have moved online. In addition to that, we have a second compounding factor pounding on it, which is platforms are changing. The use of mobile phones, iPads, you know instant search, too, but also GAO. The fact that you get each instant location. You can get coupons. All these things from a platform perspective are driving it on top of it.
And then finally, it is true that Jonathan's team's fantastic job at making great ads tuning and monetization like the Visible URL  and, Jonathan, you may want to take a second to talk about this URL  it is those factors that are really driving the CPC growth and the click-through rate growth rather than instant search.
So I just want to be clear because I know there is a rumor on the street running that it's all about instant search. And instant search is about the user. It is people spending 10% faster. That is a huge number, 10%, and that is why we did instant search. So may be Visible URL is a good example that you want to talk about, Jonathan.
>>Jonathan Rosenberg
Yes, sure. I guess other than the ad's quality improvements, which I can cover in a second, I think the only other area that Patrick did not cover would basically just be the new ad formats, all of which are boosting click through rates. And I mentioned those in my prepared remarks, the product listing ads more, recently offer ads, coupon-based ads. The seller ratings, which we have also launched, have significant impact in click-through rates, as low as does site link.
But I think that probably the most significant thing in terms of what impacted the whole ad area this quarter was this concept that we call visible URL. And basically what we did was on the top ads we moved the advertiser's URL down to its own separate line below the creative rather than having it be part of the creative. And that obviously made it easier for people to see where they will go if they click. It is actually a little bit of an interesting story. I will give you some of the background on this because I think this is by far the most significant change that we have from an ad's quality perspective in a very long time.
It turned out early in the quarter some of the engineers in Japan noticed that it was really hard to recreate it because we actually had the ad's URL, which was in Latin characters mixed in with the ad creative, which was in Kanji. And it did not really take brilliant research to figure out that human perception gets really confused when characters switch like that in the middle of a sentence. People just sort of skip the whole sentence. And if they skip something, that is sort of really bad when that sentence is a text ad.
 
So we ran this experiment in Japan, and we moved the URL down to its own line, and click-through rates went up dramatically. So we launched that feature pretty expeditiously in, I think, Japan, China, Korea and Russia. And then what happens is the engineers kind of said, well, hey, just for fun, let's try that in the rest of the world. And we actually did not expect so much because we did not have the same dynamic of Latin characters versus Kanji, but it turned out that people skipped sentences with long unusual words in it. So people were tuning out that line, and we quickly launched this feature globally. It was one of the fastest things that we ever launched after the ad testing. I believe we launched it right around Thanksgiving. And that had a very significant change in the clicks that we saw in the course of the quarter.
>>Patrick Pichette
So just to close on that, just to kind of say, it is  and I know that Jonathan has used that trumpet a number of times in the past  but it just continues to illustrate how much more innovation there is left in both formats and in just all of the things that we do in terms of innovation in the ad space.
Operator
Jeetil Patel, Deutsche Bank.
>>Jeetil Patel
If we look at your the revenue line from a customer base standpoint whether it is Fortune 500 or Ad Age 100 versus Internet pure-play endemics, and then the small to medium-sized business category, I guess the SMB category was weaker as opposed to during the credit crisis and had a hard time coming back. I'm curious as to your thoughts as to how it is coming back today? Do you think there is a different way of approaching that SMB market as you look ahead into this year and going forward in terms of products or may be ways to help drive leads or sales for that segment of the market?
>>Patrick Pichette
I will let Nikesh answer that question. Just one point of clarification on your statement, though. And during the recession a couple of years ago, I think you mentioned that we thought that SMBs were kind of going down. And in fact, Nikesh will clarify that, they were going the other way. So Nikesh, I will leave it to you to answer the question.
>>Nikesh Arora
I think the important thing to understand is that we are seeing such a disproportionate amount of strength from the very large advertisers across the board. Because effectively what is happened over the years is that they have gone out and really strengthened their e-commerce offerings. They have gotten their act together. They have got all the logistics in place. Given that this was the quarter of Christmas and Thanksgiving, you saw tremendous amounts of strength from large advertisers wanting to play against the pure-play Internet players.
Now, in addition to that, what has also happened is we have put in efforts over the last six months on the SMB and midmarket side. On the midmarket side, we have basically gone ahead and adopted a higher touch strategy, i.e. we spent more time on the phone with our customers. We even go and visit some of our mid-tier customers because to be fair over the years they have grown to be larger mid-tier customers than they used to be in the past. So we have put in sort of a conscious higher touch strategy.
And last but not least, with the smaller advertisers, we are working very closely with our product team and Jonathan and his team to try and look at various systemic and algorithmic improvements we can make working with them in large direct marketing campaigns where we can continue to reduce churn in that area and continue to acquire more, which is related to the earlier comment on slightly higher sales spending on trying to acquire smaller advertisers. So we have that source across the board, across all three categories. We don't think that effort is done and fully over with.
 
>>Jeetil Patel
Do you think the business model or pricing model has to be different there whether it is percentage of sales or some other kind of approach to going after the spend in that segment?
>>Patrick Pichette
I think to be fair, if you look at some of the simplification we have done on the AdWords side on our local products, which is another way of thinking about smaller advertisers, that is a way to create a simpler product for them where they don't have to put in a lot more effort or we have things like keyword less ads so they don't have to go ahead and work towards creating keywords or we have to go out  on the display side, we have got contextual targeting where we can create ad groups very, very quickly.
So we may continue to make product improvements which allow things to become more and more simple so advertisers can go and do their daily business as opposed to spend time understanding more complicated stuff on our side. So yes, you are right. They are different, simpler products we create for them which has slightly different pricing so that they can continue to participate in the online economy.
Operator
Jason Maynard, Wells Fargo Securities.
>>Jason Maynard
I had a question just on the mobile business. Last quarter obviously saw some increased momentum. I'm curious just from a pricing perspective what you're starting to see from advertisers, and what kind of progress did you see over the last 90 days? And may be more importantly, as [NFC] starts to become more prevalent in smartphones, I mean how do you think that changes the dynamic in terms of what type of effective monetization you are going to see from the local commerce side?
>>Patrick Pichette
So let me give you just a few statistics to continue to keep the context. Mobile search grew 4 times on mobile devices with Web browsers in the last year. So there is no doubt that this market is just absolutely cranking. And there is a lot of work  and I will let Jonathan talk about it  about how ad formats are still kind of nascent and building both on the display side and on the regular side, and we see a lot of upside.
Jonathan, you probably want to cover those.
>>Jonathan Rosenberg
Yes. You know we don't really actually break out the details in terms of the exact differences. Certainly the click-to-call ads are generating millions of calls every month. A lot of advertisers are running these campaigns. I think one you can see if you try it is DirecTV.
We did launch a call only option where the only clickable link in the ad is actually a phone number, which not surprisingly substantially increases the click-through rates on mobile devices. And we have extended some of the desktop formats pretty successfully to mobile. Site links is one. If you try a query on Oakley, you will see one. If you try seller ratings on something like running shoes. So I think there is a lot more to learn there. But the advertisers are very excited and engaged.
At the moment I don't have any specific comments on [NFC], other than to go back to the statements that I made in previous calls, which is when people are completing transactions with these devices, it becomes much more trackable and obviously significantly more valuable.
Operator
Steve Weinstein, Pacific Crest.
 
>>Steve Weinstein
First, you commented that you were going to be shifting more compensation to base pay from bonus. I was wondering if you could let us know what the ratio had been historically as far as those two components of comp?
And then finally, obviously the acceleration in all the metrics is pretty exciting and pretty positive for the outlook. I was wondering if you could help us understand, though, how much acceleration is happening within the core business and how much of the acceleration is may be some of the newer businesses really starting to get some scale and may be tipping the overall momentum in the business?
>>Patrick Pichette
Thank you for the question on compensation, first. As I said, we raised all salaries. So if you think of financial modeling for a second, all salaries have been raised 10% across-the-board January 1. And that has a ripple effect on the kind of ripple effect of the employee taxes, 401(k)s and all the rest of the benefits.
It will also impact obviously everybody that we will bring on this year as well. So, as we bring in new people, they are costing us now slightly more.
In addition to that, what we have done is part of the bonus is kind of calculated. Without giving you the exact number, we had two components to our annual bonus, one which is a company multiplier and one which is an individual multiplier. And what we have done for the non-execs  because we want execs to actually continue to be treated differently, the non-execs are treated in that what used to be the Company multiplier, which they did not really have a lot of influence on, we shifted over to base pay. And their individual multiplier component of the bonus continues to be a very directly involved into their calculation of their personal bonus.
So by shifting that Company multiplier, which they did not have a lot of influence on, it just moves it into more predictable cash flows for them all through the year rather than waiting for the end of the year. That was the rationale for doing it.
In terms of revenue growth, I mean last quarter we gave two indication points on display, on mobile. We have talked about the fact that our core  if you look at our enterprise business of 30 million users, 3 million businesses on apps, the kind of magnitudes of numbers we are talking about in each of our growth areas whether it be mobile, whether it be Android, whether it be YouTube, where we continue to have YouTube, right? I mean to give you a snippet  YouTube's revenue more than doubled in 2010.
So that is why we are optimistic across the board, and that is why we are very kind of open about the fact when you have such a digital economy running in high gear, why don't you take the opportunity to invest at the time where it is actually transforming itself, and that is what we are doing. And we are delighted, in fact, to continue to push hard on that. And that's what you see also in sales and marketing.
So thanks for your question.
With that, let me reiterate. And so to them, thank you so much for your fantastic efforts in 2010. We are just set up for a fantastic 2011, again.
With that, I will let Jay close the call.

That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
In connection with the management changes that Google Inc. announced on January 20, 2011, the members of the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee of Google's Board of Directors (LDCC) approved equity awards for Eric Schmidt in the aggregate amount of $100 million on January 21, 2011. Consistent with Google's equity-granting practice, stock options and Google Stock Units (GSUs) will be granted in the ratio of two stock options for each GSU, which will result in a GSU grant value of approximately $55.6 million and an option grant value of approximately $44.4 million.
The equity awards will be granted on February 2, 2011 (the first Wednesday of the month following the date on which the LDCC approved the grant) and will vest over a four-year period.
The exact number of GSUs comprising the equity award will be calculated by dividing the GSU grant value by the closing price of Google's Class A common stock on February 1, 2011. The exact number of stock options comprising the equity award will be calculated by dividing the option grant value by 40% of the closing price of Google's Class A common stock on February 1, 2011. Both equity awards will be rounded up to the nearest whole share.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include statements regarding our plans to invest heavily in innovation, our expected stock-based compensation charges, and our plans to make significant capital expenditures. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, unforeseen changes in our hiring patterns and our need to expend capital to accommodate the growth of the business, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, which is on file with the SEC, and is available on our investor relations website at investor.google.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2011, which we expect to file with the SEC in May 2011. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of April 14, 2011, and Google undertakes no duty to update this information.
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, and free cash flow. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations
 
measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures" and "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow" included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our "recurring core business operating results," meaning our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
 We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income plus stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenues. Google considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of stock-based compensation so that Google's management and investors can compare Google's recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under ASC Topic 718, Google's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between Google's recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing Google's management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Google's own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, non-GAAP operating income excludes some costs, namely, stock-based compensation, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Google's business. Second, stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Third, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin.
 We define non-GAAP net income as net income plus stock-based compensation less the related tax effects. We define non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average outstanding shares, on a fully-diluted basis. We
Non-GAAP net income and EPS.
 
consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that Google uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results, we exclude from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS the tax effects associated with stock-based compensation. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results. The same limitations described above regarding Google's use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS together with net income and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP.
. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement and under the caption "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K. Google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.

indemnifying party
 
indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.

Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by the second and third sentences of this paragraph, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
Section 8(a)
Section 8(b)
(d) To the extent the indemnification provided for in paragraph (a) or (b) of this is unavailable to an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each indemnifying party under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand in connection with the offering of the Securities shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Final Prospectus, bear to the aggregate offering price of the Securities. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to
Section 8
 
state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters' respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to above in this paragraph (d) shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this , no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.

If, within 36 hours after any such default by any Underwriter, the Representatives do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to purchase such Securities on such terms. If another party or other parties become obligated or agree to purchase the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter, either the Representatives or the Company may postpone the Closing Date for up to seven days in order to effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other document or arrangement, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus that effects any such changes.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
We have acted as special United States counsel to Google Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Company's offering pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-), of $[amount] aggregate principal amount of [interest rate]% Notes due [year] (the "Securities") to be issued under an indenture dated as of [date] (the "Indenture") between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"). Such registration statement, as amended as of its most recent effective date ([date]), insofar as it relates to the Securities (as determined for purposes of Rule 430B(f)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act")), but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Registration Statement;" the related prospectus dated [date] included in the Registration Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act, but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Base Prospectus;" the preliminary prospectus supplement dated [date], as filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Preliminary Prospectus Supplement;" and the related prospectus supplement dated [date], as filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Final Prospectus Supplement." The Base Prospectus and the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement together are herein called the "Pricing Prospectus," and the Base Prospectus and the Final Prospectus Supplement together are herein called the "Final Prospectus." This opinion letter is furnished pursuant to Section 6(b) of the Underwriting Agreement dated [date], in the form in which it was incorporated into the Terms Agreement dated [date] (together, the "Underwriting Agreement") between the Company and the several underwriters named in Schedule I thereto (the "Underwriters").
            
In arriving at the opinions expressed below, we have reviewed the following documents:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, we have reviewed the originals or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction of all such corporate records of the Company and such other documents, and we have made such investigations of law, as we have deemed appropriate as a basis for the opinions expressed below.
In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity to the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies. In addition, we have assumed and have not verified the accuracy as to factual matters of each document we have reviewed (including, without limitation, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company in the Underwriting Agreement).
Based on the foregoing, and subject to the further assumptions and qualifications set forth below, it is our opinion that:
1. The Company is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
2. The Company has corporate power to own its properties and conduct its business as described in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus (including the documents incorporated by reference therein), and the Company has corporate power to issue the Securities, to enter into the Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture and to perform its obligations thereunder.
3. The execution and delivery of the Indenture have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company, and the Indenture has been duly executed and delivered by the Company, and qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act"), and is a valid, binding and enforceable agreement of the Company.
4. The execution and delivery of the Securities have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company, and the Securities have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and are the valid, binding and enforceable obligations of the Company, entitled to the benefits of the Indenture.
5. The execution and delivery of the Underwriting Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company, and the Underwriting Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company.
6. The issuance and sale of the Securities to the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement do not, and the performance by the Company of its obligations in the Underwriting Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities will not, (a) require any filing, consent, approval, authorization, registration or qualification of or with any governmental authority of the United States or the State of New York that in our experience normally would be applicable to general business entities with respect to such issuance, sale or performance, except such as have been obtained or effected under the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act (but we express no opinion relating to any state securities or Blue Sky laws and we have assumed for purposes of the foregoing opinion that the Company is
 
not required to make any filing pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act because a free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) was prepared or used by the Underwriters), (b) result in a breach of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under, any of the agreements of the Company that were filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement and filed pursuant to Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K, or a violation of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, or contravene (based solely on inquiry of [name], [title] of the Company) any judgment, decree or order applicable to the Company of any court or other governmental authority having jurisdiction over the Company or (c) result in a violation of any United States federal or New York State law or published rule or regulation that in our experience normally would be applicable to general business entities with respect to such issuance, sale or performance (but we express no opinion relating to the United States federal securities laws or any state securities or Blue Sky laws).
7. The Company is not and, after giving effect to the offering and sale of the Securities and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in the Disclosure Package and the Final Prospectus, will not be, required to register as an "investment company" as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
8. The statements under the headings "Description of [Securities]" and "Description of Debt Securities" in the Pricing Prospectus considered together with the document attached as Annex I hereto and the Final Prospectus, insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain provisions of the Securities and the Indenture, provide a fair summary of such provisions.
9. The statements under the heading ["Certain United States Federal Tax Considerations"] in the Pricing Prospectus and the Final Prospectus, insofar as such statements purport to summarize certain federal tax laws of the United States, constitute a fair summary of the principal U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the Securities.
Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to the valid existence and good standing of the Company, they are based solely on a certificate of good standing received from the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and on a telephonic confirmation from such Secretary of State. Insofar as the foregoing opinions relate to the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any agreement or obligation of the Company, (a) we have assumed that the Company and each other party to such agreement or obligation has satisfied those legal requirements that are applicable to it to the extent necessary to make such agreement or obligation enforceable against it (except that no such assumption is made as to the Company regarding matters of the federal law of the United States of America, the law of the State of New York or the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware that in our experience normally would be applicable to general business entities with respect to such agreement or obligation) and (b) such opinions are subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and to general principles of equity.
The foregoing opinions are limited to the federal law of the United States of America, the law of the State of New York and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
We are furnishing this opinion letter to you, as Representatives of the Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in their capacity as such in connection with the offering of the Securities. This opinion letter is not to be relied on by or furnished to any other person or used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose, except that numbered paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of this opinion letter may be relied upon by the Trustee, in its capacity as such. We assume no obligation to advise you, or to make any investigations, as to any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof that might affect the opinions expressed herein.

Such registration statement, as amended as of its most recent effective date ([date]), insofar as it relates to the Securities (as determined for purposes of Rule 430B(f)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act")), but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein and Exhibit 25, is herein called the "Registration Statement;" the related prospectus dated [date] included in the Registration Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act, but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Base Prospectus;" the preliminary prospectus supplement dated [date], as filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Preliminary Prospectus Supplement;" and the related prospectus supplement dated [date], as filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, but excluding the documents incorporated by reference therein, is herein called the "Final Prospectus Supplement." The Base Prospectus and the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement together are herein called the "Pricing Prospectus," and the Base Prospectus and the Final Prospectus Supplement together are herein called the "Final Prospectus." This letter is furnished pursuant to Section 6(b) of the Underwriting Agreement dated [date], in the form in which it was incorporated into the Terms Agreement dated [date] (together, the "Underwriting Agreement") between the Company and the several underwriters named in Schedule I thereto (the "Underwriters").
            
Because the primary purpose of our professional engagement was not to establish or confirm factual matters or financial, accounting or statistical information, and because many determinations involved in the preparation of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, the documents incorporated by reference in each of them and the document attached as Annex I hereto are of a wholly or partially non-legal character or relate to legal matters outside the scope of our opinion letter to you of even date herewith, we are not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, the documents incorporated by reference in each of them or the document attached as Annex I hereto (except to the extent expressly set forth in numbered paragraphs 8 and 9 of our opinion letter to you of even date herewith), and we make no representation that we have independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of such statements (except as aforesaid). We also are not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for ascertaining whether or when any of the Pricing Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, the documents incorporated by reference in each of them or the document attached as Annex I hereto was conveyed to any person for purposes of Rule 159 under the Securities Act.
However, in the course of our acting as special United States counsel to the Company in connection with its preparation of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and the document attached as Annex I hereto, we participated in conferences and telephone conversations
 
with representatives of the Company, representatives of the independent public accountants for the Company, your representatives and representatives of your counsel, during which conferences and conversations the contents of the Registration Statement, the Pricing Prospectus, the Final Prospectus, portions of certain of the documents incorporated by reference in each of them and the document attached as Annex I hereto, and related matters were discussed, and we reviewed certain corporate records and documents furnished to us by the Company.
Based on our participation in such conferences and conversations and our review of such records and documents as described above, our understanding of the U.S. federal securities laws and the experience we have gained in our practice thereunder, we advise you that:
(a) The Registration Statement (except the financial statements and schedules and other financial and accounting data included therein, as to which we express no view), at the time it became effective, and the Final Prospectus (except as aforesaid), as of the date thereof, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder. In addition, we do not know of any contracts or other documents of a character required to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement or required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Final Prospectus that are not filed or described as required.
(b) The documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus (except the financial statements and schedules and other financial and accounting data and management's report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included therein, as to which we express no view), as of the respective dates of their filing with the Commission, appeared on their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder.
(c) No information has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Registration Statement, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (except the financial statements and schedules and other financial and accounting data and management's report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included therein, as to which we express no view), at the time it became effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.
(d) No information has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Pricing Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference therein, considered together with the document attached as Annex I hereto (except in each case the financial statements and schedules and other financial and accounting data and management's report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included therein, as to which we express no view), at the time of execution of the Underwriting Agreement, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
(e) No information has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Final Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference therein (except in each case the financial statements and schedules and other financial and accounting data and management's report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included therein, as to which we express no view), as of the date thereof or hereof, contained or contains
 
an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.
We confirm to you that (a) based solely upon email confirmation of receipt of the filing and Rule 462(e) under the Securities Act, the Registration Statement is effective under the Securities Act, and (b) based solely upon a telephonic confirmation from a representative of the Commission, no stop order with respect thereto has been issued by the Commission, and to the best of our knowledge, no proceeding for that purpose has been instituted or threatened by the Commission.
In addition, we confirm to you that, based solely on inquiry of [name], [title] of the Company, we know of no legal or governmental proceedings to which the Company is a party that are currently pending before any adjudicative tribunal or that have been threatened by a written communication manifesting an intention to initiate such proceedings received by the management of the Company or by us that are required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement or the documents incorporated by reference therein that are not disclosed in the Pricing Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference therein and the document attached as Annex I hereto and the Final Prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference therein.
We are furnishing this letter to you, as Representatives of the Underwriters, solely for the benefit of the Underwriters in their capacity as such in connection with the offering of the Securities. This letter is not to be relied on by or furnished to any other person or used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for any other purpose. We assume no obligation to advise you, or to make any investigations, as to any legal developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof that might affect the views expressed herein.

If a payment date is not a Business Day as defined in the Indenture at a Place of Payment, payment may be made at that place on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day, and no interest shall accrue for the intervening period.

The Indenture contains provisions that provide that the Company and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the purpose of amending any provisions of the Indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities of such series to be affected with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series affected by such amendment voting separately; that, without the consent of each Holder of the Securities of each series affected thereby, an amendment may not: (i) extend the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of interest on, such Holder's Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or the interest thereon or any premium payable upon redemption thereof, or change the Currency in which the principal of and premium, if any, or interest on such Security is denominated or payable, or reduce the amount of the principal of an Original Issue Discount Security that would be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof, or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof (or, in the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date), or materially adversely affect the economic terms of the Holder's right to convert or exchange any Security as may be provided in the Indenture; (ii) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, the consent of whose Holders is required for any supplemental indenture, or the consent of whose Holders is required for any waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Indenture or certain Defaults hereunder and their consequences provided for in the Indenture; (iii) modify any of the provisions of the Indenture governing amendments or waivers with the consent of Holders except to increase any such percentage or to provide that certain other provisions of the Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected thereby; or (iv) modify, without the written consent of the Trustee, the rights, duties or immunities of the Trustee.

It is also provided in the Indenture that, subject to certain conditions and exceptions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of a series of Securities at the time Outstanding may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Securities of such series waive any past Default or Event of Default hereunder and its consequences except a Default in the payment of interest or any premium on or the principal of the Securities of such series or a Default in respect of a covenant or provision of the Indenture that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series. Upon any such waiver, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities of such series shall be restored to their former positions and rights under the Indenture, respectively; that no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
provided
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note in the manner, at the place, at the respective times, at the rate and in the coin or currency herein prescribed.
The Notes will be issued in fully registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of $2,000 and multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof and are transferable and exchangeable at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose, which shall initially be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture.
The Notes are redeemable prior to maturity at the Company's option, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, by paying a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of
the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption), discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at a rate equal to the sum of the applicable Treasury Rate plus 5 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to the date of redemption. Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of record of the Notes.
For the purposes of determining the redemption price, "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per year equal to: (1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue; provided that, if no maturity is within three months before or after the Remaining Life of the Notes to be redeemed, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from those yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month; or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the related Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date. The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third business day preceding the redemption date. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term ("Remaining Life") of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes. "Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers that the Company appoints to act as the Independent Investment Banker from time to time. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding such redemption date. As used in the immediately preceding sentence and in the definition of "Treasury Rate" above, the term "business day" means any day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which commercial banks in New York City are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means (1) each of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and their respective successors, unless any of them ceases to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), in which case the Company shall substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer and (2) any other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Company.
Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose, which shall initially be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, a new Note or Notes of authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount shall be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor, subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.
The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute owner of this Note (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon), for the purpose of receiving payment of, or on account of, the principal hereof and, subject to the provisions hereof, interest hereon, and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement contained in the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto or in any Note, or because of any indebtedness evidenced thereby, shall be had against any incorporator as such, or against any past, present or future stockholder, officer, director or employee, as such, of the Company or of any successor, either directly or through the Company or any successor, under any rule of law, statute or constitutional provision or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof.
Terms used herein that are defined in the Indenture shall have the respective meanings assigned thereto in the Indenture.
The laws of the State of New York (without regard to conflicts of laws principles thereof) shall govern this Note.

It is also provided in the Indenture that, subject to certain conditions and exceptions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of a series of Securities at the time Outstanding may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Securities of such series waive any past Default or Event of Default hereunder and its consequences except a Default in the payment of interest or any premium on or the principal of the Securities of such series or a Default in respect of a covenant or provision of the Indenture that cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series. Upon any such waiver, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities of such series shall be restored to their former positions and rights under the Indenture, respectively; that no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
provided
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note in the manner, at the place, at the respective times, at the rate and in the coin or currency herein prescribed.
The Notes will be issued in fully registered form without coupons in minimum denominations of $2,000 and multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof and are transferable and exchangeable at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose, which shall initially be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture.
The Notes are redeemable prior to maturity at the Company's option, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, by paying a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of
the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption), discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at a rate equal to the sum of the applicable Treasury Rate plus 10 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to the date of redemption. Notice of redemption will be mailed at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of record of the Notes.
For the purposes of determining the redemption price, "Treasury Rate" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per year equal to: (1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue; provided that, if no maturity is within three months before or after the Remaining Life of the Notes to be redeemed, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue shall be determined and the Treasury Rate shall be interpolated or extrapolated from those yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month; or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semiannual equivalent yield to maturity of the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the related Comparable Treasury Price for such redemption date. The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third business day preceding the redemption date. "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term ("Remaining Life") of the Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of such Notes. "Independent Investment Banker" means one of the Reference Treasury Dealers that the Company appoints to act as the Independent Investment Banker from time to time. "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to any redemption date, (1) the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Independent Investment Banker obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations. "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the applicable Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third business day preceding such redemption date. As used in the immediately preceding sentence and in the definition of "Treasury Rate" above, the term "business day" means any day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which commercial banks in New York City are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close. "Reference Treasury Dealer" means (1) each of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and their respective successors, unless any of them ceases to be a primary U.S. Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), in which case the Company shall substitute another Primary Treasury Dealer and (2) any other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Company.
Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note at the office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose, which shall initially be the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, a new Note or Notes of authorized denominations for an equal aggregate principal amount shall be issued to the transferee in exchange therefor, subject to the limitations provided in the Indenture, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.
The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute owner of this Note (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon), for the purpose of receiving payment of, or on account of, the principal hereof and, subject to the provisions hereof, interest hereon, and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement contained in the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto or in any Note, or because of any indebtedness evidenced thereby, shall be had against any incorporator as such, or against any past, present or future stockholder, officer, director or employee, as such, of the Company or of any successor, either directly or through the Company or any successor, under any rule of law, statute or constitutional provision or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof.
Terms used herein that are defined in the Indenture shall have the respective meanings assigned thereto in the Indenture.
The laws of the State of New York (without regard to conflicts of laws principles thereof) shall govern this Note.

Section 162(m)

Delegation of Authority for Day-to-Day Administration
(b) . Subject to the provisions of the Plan, and in the case of a Committee, subject to the specific duties delegated by the Board to such Committee, the Administrator will have the authority, in its discretion:
Powers of the Administrator
(i) to determine the Fair Market Value;
(ii) to select the Service Providers to whom Awards may be granted hereunder;
(iii) to determine the number of Shares to be covered by each Award granted hereunder;
 
(iv) to approve forms of agreement for use under the Plan;
(v) to determine the terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, of any Award granted hereunder. Such terms and conditions include, but are not limited to, the exercise price, the time or times when Awards may be exercised (which may be based on performance criteria), any vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture or repurchase restrictions, and any restriction or limitation regarding any Award or the Shares relating thereto, based in each case on such factors as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine;
(vi) to reduce the exercise price of any Award to the then current Fair Market Value if the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock covered by such Award shall have declined since the date the Award was granted;
(vii) to institute an Exchange Program;
(viii) to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan and Awards granted pursuant to the Plan;
(ix) to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, including rules and regulations relating to sub-plans established for the purpose of satisfying applicable foreign laws and/or qualifying for preferred tax treatment under applicable foreign tax laws;
(x) to modify or amend each Award (subject to Section 18(c) of the Plan), including the discretionary authority to extend the post-termination exercisability period of Awards longer than is otherwise provided for in the Plan;
(xi) to allow Participants to satisfy withholding tax obligations by electing to have the Company withhold from the Shares or cash to be issued upon exercise or vesting of an Award that number of Shares or cash having a Fair Market Value equal to the minimum amount required to be withheld. The Fair Market Value of any Shares to be withheld will be determined on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. All elections by a Participant to have Shares or cash withheld for this purpose will be made in such form and under such conditions as the Administrator may deem necessary or advisable;
(xii) to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the Company any instrument required to effect the grant of an Award previously granted by the Administrator;
(xiii) to allow a Participant to defer the receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of Shares that would otherwise be due to such Participant under an Award;

(xix) to impose such restrictions, conditions or limitations as it determines appropriate as to the timing and manner of any resales by a Participant or other subsequent transfers by the Participant of any Shares issued as a result of or under an Award, including without limitation, (A) restrictions under an insider trading policy, and (B) restrictions as to the use of a specified brokerage firm for such resales or other transfers; and

Eligibility
6. .
Limitations
(a) . Each Option will be designated in the Award Agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option. However, notwithstanding such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by the Participant during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, such Options will be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For purposes of this Section 6(a), Incentive Stock Options will be taken into account in the order in which they were granted. The Fair Market Value of the Shares will be determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted.
ISO $100,000 Rule
(b) . Neither the Plan nor any Award shall confer upon a Participant any right with respect to continuing his or her relationship as a Service Provider, nor shall they interfere in any way with the right of the Participant or the right of the Company or its Parent or Subsidiaries to terminate such relationship at any time, with or without cause.
No Rights as a Service Provider
(c) . The following limitations shall apply to Awards under the Plan:
162(m) Limitation
(i) . No Service Provider will be granted, in any Fiscal Year, Options and/or SARs to purchase more than 1,000,000 Shares.
Option and SAR Share Annual Limit
(ii) . No Service Provider will be granted, in any Fiscal Year, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Units and/or Performance Shares to purchase more than 500,000 Shares.
Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Units and Performance Shares Annual Limit
(iii) . For purposes of qualifying grants of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares or Performance Units as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator, in its discretion, may set restrictions based upon the achievement of Performance Goals. The Performance Goals shall be set by the Administrator on or before the latest date permissible to enable the Restricted Stock Units, Restricted Stock, Performance Shares or Performance Units to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code. In granting Restricted Stock Units, Restricted Stock, Performance Shares or Performance Units which are intended to qualify under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator shall follow any procedures determined by it from time to time to be necessary or appropriate to ensure qualification of the Award under Section 162(m) of the Code (e.g., in determining the Performance Goals).
Section 162(m) Performance Restrictions
(iv) The foregoing limitations will be adjusted proportionately in connection with any change in the Company's capitalization as described in Section 15 of the Plan.
(v) If an Award is cancelled in the same Fiscal Year in which it was granted (other than in connection with a transaction described in Section 15 of the Plan), the cancelled Award will be counted against the limits set forth in subsections (i) and (ii) above. For this purpose, if the exercise price of an Option is reduced, the transaction will be treated as a cancellation of the Option and the grant of a new Option.
 
7. .
Stock Options
(a) . The term of each Option will be stated in the Award Agreement. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the term will be ten (10) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement. Moreover, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option granted to a Participant who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the term of the Incentive Stock Option will be five (5) years from the date of grant or such shorter term as may be provided in the Award Agreement.
Term of Option
(b) .
Option Exercise Price and Consideration
(i) . The per Share exercise price for the Shares to be issued pursuant to exercise of an Option will be determined by the Administrator, subject to the following:
Exercise Price
(1) In the case of an Incentive Stock Option
(A) granted to an Employee who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price will be no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
(B) granted to any Employee other than an Employee described in paragraph (A) immediately above, the per Share exercise price will be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
(2) In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option, the per Share exercise price will be determined by the Administrator. In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the per Share exercise price will be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Incentive Stock Options may be granted with a per Share exercise price of less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant pursuant to a merger or other corporate transaction.
(ii) . At the time an Option is granted, the Administrator will fix the period within which the Option may be exercised and will determine any conditions that must be satisfied before the Option may be exercised.
Waiting Period and Exercise Dates
(c) . The Administrator will determine the acceptable form of consideration for exercising an Option, including the method of payment. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the Administrator will determine the acceptable form of consideration at the time of grant. Such consideration to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws may consist entirely of:
Form of Consideration
(i) cash;
(ii) check;
(iii) promissory note;
(iv) other Shares which meet the conditions established by the Administrator to avoid adverse accounting consequences (as determined by the Administrator);
(v) consideration received by the Company under a cashless exercise program implemented by the Company in connection with the Plan;
 
(vi) a reduction in the amount of any Company liability to the Participant, including any liability attributable to the Participant's participation in any Company-sponsored deferred compensation program or arrangement;
(vii) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment; or
(viii) such other consideration and method of payment for the issuance of Shares to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.
(d) .
Exercise of Option
(i) . Any Option granted hereunder will be exercisable according to the terms of the Plan and at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Administrator and set forth in the Award Agreement. An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.
Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Stockholder
An Option will be deemed exercised when the Company receives: (x) written or electronic notice of exercise (in accordance with the Award Agreement) from the person entitled to exercise the Option, and (y) full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised. Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Award Agreement and the Plan. Shares issued upon exercise of an Option will be issued in the name of the Participant or, if requested by the Participant, in the name of the Participant and his or her spouse. Until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder will exist with respect to the Awarded Stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company will issue (or cause to be issued) such Shares promptly after the Option is exercised. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the Record Date is prior to the date the Shares are issued, except as provided in Section 15 of the Plan or the applicable Award Agreement.
Exercising an Option in any manner will decrease the number of Shares thereafter available for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.
(ii) . If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider, other than upon the Participant's death or Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for three (3) months following the Participant's termination. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if on the date of termination the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will revert to the Plan on the date one (1) month following the Participant's termination. If after termination the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified by the Administrator, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.
Termination of Relationship as a Service Provider
(iii) . If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider as a result of the Participant's Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following the Participant's termination. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if on the date of termination the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will revert to the Plan on the date one (1) month following the Participant's termination. If after termination the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.
Disability of Participant
 
(iv) . If a Participant dies while a Service Provider, the Option may be exercised following the Participant's death within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of death, or to the extent it vests pursuant to Section 23(a)(i) hereof (but in no event may the Option be exercised later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement), by the Participant's designated beneficiary, provided such beneficiary has been designated prior to Participant's death in a form acceptable to the Administrator. If no such beneficiary has been designated by the Participant, then such Option may be exercised by the personal representative of the Participant's estate or by the person(s) to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to the Participant's will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution. In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following Participant's death. If the Option is not so exercised within the time specified herein, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.
Death of Participant
(e) . The Administrator may at any time offer to buy out for a payment in cash or Shares an Option previously granted based on such terms and conditions as the Administrator shall establish and communicate to the Participant at the time that such offer is made.

Buyout Provisions
10. .
Performance Units and Performance Shares
(a) . Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, Performance Units and Performance Shares may be granted to Service Providers at any time and from time to time, as will be determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion. Subject to Section 6(c)(ii), the Administrator will have complete discretion in determining the number of Performance Units and Performance Shares granted to each Participant.
Grant of Performance Units/Shares
(b) . Each Performance Unit will have an initial value that is established by the Administrator on or before the date of grant. Each Performance Share will have an initial value equal to the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant.
Value of Performance Units/Shares
 
(c) . The Administrator will set performance objectives in its discretion which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the number or value of Performance Units/Shares that will be paid out to the Service Providers. The time period during which the performance objectives must be met will be called the "Performance Period." Each Award of Performance Units/ Shares will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the Performance Period, and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine. The Administrator may set performance objectives based upon the achievement of Company-wide, divisional, or individual goals, applicable federal or state securities laws, or any other basis determined by the Administrator in its discretion.
Performance Objectives and Other Terms
(d) . After the applicable Performance Period has ended, the holder of Performance Units/Shares will be entitled to receive a payout of the number of Performance Units/Shares earned by the Participant over the Performance Period, to be determined as a function of the extent to which the corresponding performance objectives have been achieved. After the grant of a Performance Unit/Share, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any performance objectives for such Performance Unit/Share.

Unless the Administrator provides otherwise, vesting of Awards granted hereunder will be suspended during any unpaid leave of absence and will resume on the date the Participant returns to work on a regular schedule as determined by the Company; provided, however, that no vesting credit will be awarded for the time vesting has been suspended during such leave of absence.

Notwithstanding the preceding, the number of Shares subject to any Award always shall be a whole number.

In addition, the Administrator may provide that any Company repurchase option or forfeiture rights applicable to any Award shall lapse 100%, and that any Award vesting shall accelerate 100%, provided the proposed dissolution or liquidation takes place at the time and in the manner contemplated. To the extent it has not been previously exercised or vested, an Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action.
Dissolution or Liquidation
(c) .
Merger or Change in Control
(i) . In the event of a merger or Change in Control, each outstanding Option and SAR shall be assumed or an equivalent option or SAR substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. With respect to Options and SARs granted to an Outside Director that are assumed or substituted for, if immediately prior to or after the merger or Change in Control the Participant's status as a Director or a director of the successor corporation, as applicable, is terminated other than upon a voluntary resignation by the Participant, then the Participant shall fully vest in and have the right to exercise such Options and SARs as to all of the Awarded Stock, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested or exercisable. Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, in the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Option or SAR, the Participant shall fully vest in and have the right to exercise the Option or SAR as to all of the Awarded Stock, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested or exercisable. If an Option or SAR is not assumed or substituted in the event of a merger or Change in Control, the Administrator shall notify the Participant in writing or electronically that the Option or SAR shall be exercisable, to the extent vested, for a period of up to fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, and the Option or SAR shall terminate upon the expiration of such period. For the purposes of this paragraph, the Option or SAR shall be considered assumed if, following the merger or Change in Control, the option or stock appreciation right confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share of Awarded Stock subject to the Option or SAR immediately prior to the merger or Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the merger or Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the merger or Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of the Option or SAR, for each Share of Awarded Stock subject to the Option or SAR, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or Change in Control. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more performance goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such performance goals without the Participant's consent; provided, however, a modification to such performance goals only to reflect the successor corporation's post-merger or post-Change in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.

In the event of a merger or Change in Control, each outstanding Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award and Restricted Stock Unit awards shall be assumed or an equivalent Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award and Restricted Stock Unit award substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. With respect to Awards granted to an Outside Director that are assumed or substituted for, if immediately prior to or after the merger or Change in Control the Participant's status as a Director or a director of the successor corporation, as applicable, is terminated other than upon a voluntary resignation by the Participant, then the Participant shall fully vest in such Awards, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested. Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, in the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award or Restricted Stock Unit award, the Participant shall fully vest in the Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award or Restricted Stock Unit including as to Shares which would not otherwise be vested. For the purposes of this paragraph, a Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award and Restricted Stock Unit award shall be considered assumed if, following the merger or Change in Control, the award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Award immediately prior to the merger or Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the merger or Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the merger or Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received, for each Share and each unit/right to acquire a Share subject to the Award, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or Change in Control. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more performance goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such performance goals without the Participant's consent; provided, however, a modification to such performance goals only to reflect the successor corporation's post-merger or post-Change in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.
Restricted Stock, Performance Shares, Performance Units, Restricted Stock Units and Other Stock Based Awards
16. . The date of grant of an Award will be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the determination granting such Award, or such other later date as is determined by the Administrator. Notice of the determination will be provided to each Participant within a reasonable time after the date of such grant.
Date of Grant
17. . Subject to Section 22 of the Plan, the Plan will become effective upon its adoption by the Board. It will continue in effect for a term of ten (10) years unless terminated earlier under Section 18 of the Plan.
Term of Plan
18. .
Amendment and Termination of the Plan
(a) . The Board may at any time amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan.
Amendment and Termination
(b) . The Company will obtain stockholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with Applicable Laws.
Stockholder Approval
(c) . Subject to Section 20 of the Plan, no amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan will impair the rights of any Participant, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Participant and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Participant and the Company. Termination of the Plan will not affect the Administrator's ability to exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to Awards granted under the Plan prior to the date of such termination.
Effect of Amendment or Termination
 
19. .
Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares
(a) . Shares will not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Award unless the exercise of such Award and the issuance and delivery of such Shares will comply with Applicable Laws and will be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
Legal Compliance
(b) . As a condition to the exercise or receipt of an Award, the Company may require the person exercising or receiving such Award to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise or receipt that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required.
Investment Representations
20. . Notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Plan or an Award to the contrary, if any one or more of the provisions (or any part thereof) of this Plan or the Awards shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such provision shall be modified so as to make it valid, legal and enforceable, and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions (or any part thereof) of the Plan or Award, as applicable, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
Severability
21. . The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, will relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority will not have been obtained.
Inability to Obtain Authority
22. . The Plan will be subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date the Plan is adopted. Such stockholder approval will be obtained in the manner and to the degree required under Applicable Laws.
Stockholder Approval
23. .
Vesting Acceleration of Awards Upon Death
(a) .
Stock Options and SARs
(i) . If a Participant dies while a Service Provider, and at the time of such Participant's death the Participant is not an Officer, all Shares covered by the unvested portion of each outstanding Option and SAR held by the Participant will immediately accelerate upon the Participant's death and become exercisable pursuant to Section 7(d)(iv) hereof.
Non-Officer Participants
(ii) . If a Participant dies while a Service Provider, and at the time of such Participant's death the Participant is an Officer, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of each outstanding Option and SAR held by the Participant as of the Participant's death will immediately revert to the Plan on the date one (1) month following the Participant's death, and the Participant will not be entitled to exercise such Shares pursuant to Section 7(d)(iv) hereof; provided, however, that all Shares covered by the vested portion of the Option or SAR, as applicable, shall remain exercisable pursuant to Section 7(d)(iv) hereof.
Officers
(b) . If a Participant dies while a Service Provider, and at the time of such Participant's death the Participant is not an Officer, then each outstanding Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award or Restricted Stock Unit held by the Participant upon the Participant's death will vest, including as to Shares which would not otherwise be vested, and with respect to such Awards with performance-based vesting, all performance goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at 100% on-target levels and all other terms and conditions met. Participants who are Officers at the time of their death will not be entitled to such accelerated vesting.

Amendment No. 1
Original Filing
 
At Google's 2011 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on June 2, 2011, Google's stockholders voted on, among other matters, a proposal on the frequency of future stockholder advisory votes regarding compensation awarded to named executive officers. As previously reported by Google, the frequency of once every three years received the highest number of votes cast, as well as a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. Based on these results, and consistent with Google's recommendation, Google's Board of Directors has determined that Google will conduct future stockholder advisory votes regarding compensation awarded to its named executive officers once every three years. The next required stockholder advisory vote on the frequency of future stockholder advisory votes regarding compensation awarded to named executive officers will be conducted at Google's 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

Exhibit 99.1
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  July 14, 2011 Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2011.
"We had a great quarter, with revenue up 32% year on year for a record breaking over $9 billion of revenue," said Larry Page, CEO of Google. "I'm super excited about the amazing response to Google+ which lets you share just like in real life."
Q2 Financial Summary
Google reported revenues of $9.03 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2011, an increase of 32% compared to the second quarter of 2010. Google reports its revenues, consistent with GAAP, on a gross basis without deducting traffic acquisition costs (TAC). In the second quarter of 2011, TAC totaled $2.11 billion, or 24% of advertising revenues.
Google reports operating income, operating margin, net income, and earnings per share (EPS) on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP measures, as well as free cash flow, an alternative non-GAAP measure of liquidity, are described below and are reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures in the accompanying financial tables.
 
 
 
 
Q2 Financial Highlights
  Google reported revenues of $9.03 billion in the second quarter of 2011, representing a 32% increase over second quarter 2010 revenues of $6.82 billion. Google reports its revenues, consistent with GAAP, on a gross basis without deducting TAC.
Revenues
  Google-owned sites generated revenues of $6.23 billion, or 69% of total revenues, in the second quarter of 2011. This represents a 39% increase over second quarter 2010 revenues of $4.50 billion.
Google Sites Revenues
  Google's partner sites generated revenues, through AdSense programs, of $2.48 billion, or 28% of total revenues, in the second quarter of 2011. This represents a 20% increase from second quarter 2010 network revenues of $2.06 billion.
Google Network Revenues
 
  Revenues from outside of the United States totaled $4.87 billion, representing 54% of total revenues in the second quarter of 2011, compared to 53% in the first quarter of 2011 and 52% in the second quarter of 2010. Excluding gains related to our foreign exchange risk management program, had foreign exchange rates remained constant from the first quarter of 2011 through the second quarter of 2011, our revenues in the second quarter of 2011 would have been $167 million lower. Excluding gains related to our foreign exchange risk management program, had foreign exchange rates remained constant from the second quarter of 2010 through the second quarter of 2011, our revenues in the second quarter of 2011 would have been $417 million lower.
International Revenues
 
 
A reconciliation of our non-GAAP international revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange and hedging to GAAP international revenues is included in the accompanying financial tables.
  Aggregate paid clicks, which include clicks related to ads served on Google sites and the sites of our AdSense partners, increased approximately 18% over the second quarter of 2010 and decreased approximately 2% over the first quarter of 2011.
Paid Clicks
  Average cost-per-click, which includes clicks related to ads served on Google sites and the sites of our AdSense partners, increased approximately 12% over the second quarter of 2010 and increased approximately 6% over the first quarter of 2011.
Cost-Per-Click
  Traffic Acquisition Costs, the portion of revenues shared with Google's partners, increased to $2.11 billion in the second quarter of 2011, compared to TAC of $1.73 billion in the second quarter of 2010. TAC as a percentage of advertising revenues was 24% in the second quarter of 2011, compared to 26% in the second quarter of 2010.
TAC
The majority of TAC is related to amounts ultimately paid to our AdSense partners, which totaled $1.75 billion in the second quarter of 2011. TAC also includes amounts ultimately paid to certain distribution partners and others who direct traffic to our website, which totaled $355 million in the second quarter of 2011.
  Other cost of revenues, which is comprised primarily of data center operational expenses, amortization of intangible assets, content acquisition costs as well as credit card processing charges, increased to $1.06 billion, or 12% of revenues, in the second quarter of 2011, compared to $735 million, or 11% of revenues, in the second quarter of 2010.
Other Cost of Revenues
  Operating expenses, other than cost of revenues, were $2.97 billion in the second quarter of 2011, or 33% of revenues, compared to $1.99 billion in the second quarter of 2010, or 29% of revenues.
Operating Expenses
  In the second quarter of 2011, the total charge related to SBC was $435 million, compared to $309 million in the second quarter of 2010.
SBC
We currently estimate SBC charges for grants to employees prior to July 1, 2011 to be approximately $1.9 billion for 2011. This estimate does not include expenses to be recognized related to employee stock awards that are granted after June 30, 2011 or non-employee stock awards that have been or may be granted.
 
  GAAP operating income in the second quarter of 2011 was $2.88 billion, or 32% of revenues. This compares to GAAP operating income of $2.37 billion, or 35% of revenues, in the second quarter of 2010. Non-GAAP operating income in the second quarter of 2011 was $3.32 billion, or 37% of revenues. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $2.67 billion, or 39% of revenues, in the second quarter of 2010.
Operating Income
  Interest and other income, net increased to $204 million in the second quarter of 2011, compared to $69 million in the second quarter of 2010.
Interest and Other Income, Net
  Our effective tax rate was 19% for the second quarter of 2011.
Income Taxes
  GAAP net income in the second quarter of 2011 was $2.51 billion, compared to $1.84 billion in the second quarter of 2010. Non-GAAP net income was $2.85 billion in the second quarter of 2011, compared to $2.08 billion in the second quarter of 2010. GAAP EPS in the second quarter of 2011 was $7.68 on 326 million diluted shares outstanding, compared to $5.71 in the second quarter of 2010 on 322 million diluted shares outstanding. Non-GAAP EPS in the second quarter of 2011 was $8.74, compared to $6.45 in the second quarter of 2010.
Net Income
  Net cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter of 2011 totaled $3.52 billion, compared to $2.09 billion in the second quarter of 2010. In the second quarter of 2011, capital expenditures were $917 million, the majority of which was related to land and building purchases, and IT infrastructure investments, including data centers, servers, and networking equipment. Free cash flow, an alternative non-GAAP measure of liquidity, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. In the second quarter of 2011, free cash flow was $2.60 billion.
Cash Flow and Capital Expenditures
We expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures.
A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, the GAAP measure of liquidity, is included in the accompanying financial tables.
  As of June 30, 2011, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $39.1 billion.
Cash

The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, unforeseen changes in our hiring patterns and our need to expend capital to accommodate the growth of the business, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, which is on file with the SEC and is available on our investor relations website at investor.google.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2011. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of July 14, 2011, and Google undertakes no duty to update this information unless required by law.
 
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, free cash flow, and non-GAAP international revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures," "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow," and "Reconciliation from GAAP international revenues to non-GAAP international revenues" included in the accompanying financial tables.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our "recurring core business operating results," meaning our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
 We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income plus stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenues. Google considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of stock-based compensation so that Google's management and investors can compare Google's recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under FASB ASC Topic 718, Google's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between Google's recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing Google's management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Google's own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, non-GAAP operating income excludes some costs, namely, stock-based compensation, that are recurring. Stock-based compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Google's business. Second, stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Third, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin.
 
 We define non-GAAP net income as net income plus stock-based compensation less the related tax effects. We define non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average outstanding shares, on a fully-diluted basis. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors for the same reasons that Google uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results, we exclude from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS the tax effects associated with stock-based compensation. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results. The same limitations described above regarding Google's use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS together with net income and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP net income and EPS.
. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the statement of cash flows and under the caption "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K. Google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
Free cash flow
. We define non-GAAP international revenues as international revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange and hedging. Non-GAAP international revenues are calculated by translating current quarter revenues using prior quarter and prior year exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging gains realized in the current quarter. We consider non-GAAP international revenues as a useful metric as it facilitates management's internal comparison to our historical performance.

Under the Merger Agreement, Motorola may not solicit competing proposals or, subject to exceptions that permit its board of directors to take actions required by their fiduciary duties, participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding alternative business combination transactions.
Motorola may terminate the Merger Agreement under certain specified circumstances, including if its board of directors determines in good faith that it has received a superior proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement), and otherwise complies with certain terms of the Merger Agreement. In connection with a termination to accept a superior proposal, Google will be entitled to a fee of $375 million. The $375 million fee is also payable to Google in other limited circumstances involving a competing proposal and termination of the Merger Agreement.

Exhibit 99.1
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  October 13, 2011  Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2011.
"We had a great quarter," said Larry Page, CEO of Google. "Revenue was up 33% year on year and our quarterly revenue was just short of $10 billion. Google+ is now open to everyone and we just passed the 40 million user mark. People are flocking into Google+ at an incredible rate and we are just getting started!"
Q3 Financial Summary
Google reported revenues of $9.72 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2011, an increase of 33% compared to the third quarter of 2010.

Non-GAAP operating income in the third quarter of 2011 was $3.63 billion, or 37% of revenues. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $2.93 billion, or 40% of revenues, in the third quarter of 2010.

Net Income
  Net cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter of 2011 totaled $3.95 billion, compared to $2.89 billion in the third quarter of 2010. In the third quarter of 2011, capital expenditures were $680 million, the majority of which was related to IT infrastructure investments, including data centers, servers, and networking equipment.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include statements regarding our continued investments in our core areas of strategic focus, our expected SBC charges, and our plans to make significant capital expenditures. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, unforeseen changes in our hiring patterns and our need to expend capital to accommodate the growth of the business, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, which is on file with the SEC and is available on our investor relations website at investor.google.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2011. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of October 13, 2011, and we undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law.
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, free cash flow, and non-GAAP international revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures," "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow," and "Reconciliation from GAAP international revenues to non-GAAP international revenues" included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our "recurring core business operating results," meaning our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, such as SBC, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
 We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income plus expenses related to SBC and, as applicable, one-time events. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenues. Google considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of SBC and, as applicable, one-time events so that Google's management and investors can compare Google's recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under FASB ASC Topic 718, Google's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes SBC allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between Google's recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing Google's management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Google's own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, non-GAAP operating income excludes some costs, namely, SBC, that are recurring. SBC has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Google's business. Second, SBC is an important part of our employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Third, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin.
 We define non-GAAP net income as net income plus expenses related to SBC and, as applicable, one-time events less the related tax effects. We define non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average outstanding shares, on a fully-diluted basis. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that Google uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results, we exclude from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS the tax effects associated with SBC. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results. The same limitations described above regarding Google's use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS together with net income and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP net income and EPS.
. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the statement of cash flows and under the caption "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K. Google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
Free cash flow
. We define non-GAAP international revenues as international revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange and hedging. Non-GAAP international revenues are calculated by translating current quarter revenues using prior quarter and prior year exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging gains realized in the current quarter. We consider non-GAAP international revenues as a useful metric as it facilitates management's internal comparison to our historical performance.

In connection with her appointment to the Board, Ms. Greene will be granted an initial equity award of $1,000,000 in the form of Google Stock Units (GSUs) on the first Wednesday of the month following her appointment to the Board. The exact number of GSUs comprising the grant will be calculated by dividing $1,000,000 by the closing price of Google's Class A common stock on the day prior to grant. These GSUs will vest at the rate of 25% on the 25th day of the month in which the grant's first anniversary occurs, and an additional 1/48th will vest on the 25th day of each month thereafter, subject to continued service on the Board on the applicable vesting date. Following each annual stockholder meeting, Ms. Greene will also be eligible to receive Google's standard compensation arrangement for non-employee directors, which consists of an annual $350,000 GSU grant, vesting monthly over a period of four years, and an annual $75,000 cash retainer. The grant and payment following the 2012 annual stockholder meeting will be prorated based upon the time between the effective date of Ms. Greene's appointment to the Board and the date of the meeting. The GSUs are subject to the terms and conditions of Google's 2004 Stock Plan and its related grant agreements.

Exhibit 10.1
January 10, 2012
Dear Diane,
On behalf of Google Inc., I am pleased to offer you a position as a member of Google's Board of Directors (the Board) with an effective date of January 12, 2012.
As compensation for your services to Google, you will be granted an initial equity award of $1,000,000 in the form of Google Stock Units (GSUs) on the first Wednesday of the month following your initial appointment (i.e., grant date of February 1, 2012). The exact number of GSUs comprising this grant will be calculated by dividing $1,000,000 by the closing price of Google's Class A common stock on the day prior to grant. These GSUs will vest at the rate of 25% on the 25th day of the month in which the grant's first anniversary occurs, and an additional 1/48th will vest on the 25th day of each month thereafter, subject to continued service on the Board on the applicable vesting date.
Following each annual stockholder meeting, you will be eligible to receive annualized compensation of a $350,000 GSU grant and a $75,000 cash retainer for the prior year of service. Note your 2012 awards will be prorated based upon the time between the effective date of your appointment and the stockholder meeting. Shares and cash payments will be made the first Wednesday of the month following the stockholder meeting. If the US financial markets are closed on that date, GSUs will be granted on the following Wednesday. The exact number of GSUs comprising this grant will be calculated by dividing the GSU grant value by the closing price of Google's stock on the day prior to grant. These GSUs will vest monthly over a period of four years, beginning on the 25th day of the month following grant, until fully vested.
At the time of vest, any vested GSUs will convert to Google Class A common shares. If the US financial markets are closed on a vesting date, shares will vest on the next trading day. Vesting in GSUs is contingent on continued service on the Board on the applicable vesting dates. These awards and all future equity awards are subject to the terms and conditions of applicable plan documents and award agreements. Please note that ongoing compensation for service on the Board may be changed at any time at the discretion of the Board.
You will also be reimbursed for all reasonable expenses incurred by you in connection with your services to Google. All expense reimbursements are in accordance with established Google policies.
We typically hold at least four one-day Board meetings per year. Board meetings are generally held on-site at Google and we would hope that your schedule would permit you to attend all of the meetings in person (note that telephonic attendance is also possible). In addition, there may be telephonic calls to address special projects that arise from time to time. The Board has delegated certain duties to other committees, on which you may be asked to participate. At this time, we request your participation on the Audit Committee.
Nothing in this offer or the GSU agreement should be construed to interfere with or otherwise restrict in any way the rights of Google and Google's stockholders to remove any individual from the Board at any time in accordance with the provisions of applicable law.
This letter sets forth the terms of your service with Google and supersedes any prior representations or agreements, whether written or oral. This letter may not be modified or amended except by a written agreement, signed by a representative of Google and by you.
We hope that you find the above terms acceptable. You may indicate your agreement with these terms and accept this offer by signing and dating both the enclosed duplicate and original letter and returning them to Kent Walker, our General Counsel.
Diane, I am looking forward to you joining Google's Board of Directors. I believe you will make a significant contribution to Google.
Sincerely,
Google Inc.

of the Board

ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, free cash flow, and non-GAAP international revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures," "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow," and "Reconciliation from GAAP international revenues to non-GAAP international revenues" included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our "recurring core business operating results," meaning our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, such as SBC, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
 We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income plus expenses related to SBC, and, as applicable, one-time events. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenues. Google considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of SBC and as applicable, one-time events so that Google's management and investors can compare Google's recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under FASB ASC Topic 718, Google's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes SBC allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between Google's recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing Google's management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Google's own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, non-GAAP operating income excludes some costs, namely, SBC, that are recurring. SBC has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Google's business. Second, SBC is an important part of our employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Third, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin.
 We define non-GAAP net income as net income plus expenses related to SBC, and, as applicable, one-time events less the related tax effects. The tax effect of SBC is calculated using the tax-deductible portion of SBC and applying the entity-specific, U.S. federal and blended state tax rates. We define non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average outstanding shares, on a fully-diluted basis. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that Google uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results, we exclude from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS the tax effects associated with SBC. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results. The same limitations described above regarding Google's use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS together with net income and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP net income and EPS.
. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the statement of cash flows and under the caption "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K. Google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
Free cash flow
. We define non-GAAP international revenues as international revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange and hedging. Non-GAAP international revenues are calculated by translating current quarter revenues using prior quarter and prior year exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging gains realized in the current quarter. We consider non-GAAP international revenues as a useful metric as it facilitates management's internal comparison to our historical performance.

Commencement of Sales under Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan
On November 1, 2011, Eric E. Schmidt, Google's Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, adopted a stock trading plan in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Google's Policy Against Insider Trading. In February 2012, sales of Eric's Google stock may commence under this trading plan.
The pre-arranged trading plan was adopted in order to allow Eric to sell a portion of his Google stock as part of his long-term strategy for individual asset diversification and liquidity. The stock transactions pursuant to this trading plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 and Form 144 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Using this trading plan, Eric can diversify his investment portfolio and can spread stock trades out over a period of one year to reduce market impact.
As of December 31, 2011, Eric beneficially owned approximately 9.1 million shares of Class A and Class B common stock, which represented approximately 2.8% of Google's outstanding capital stock and approximately 9.7% of the voting power of Google's outstanding capital stock. Under the terms of this trading plan, Eric intends to sell up to approximately 2.4 million shares of Class A common stock. On a pro forma basis as of December 31, 2011 assuming all shares are sold under the trading plan, Eric would own approximately 6.7 million shares, which would represent as of such date approximately 2.1% of Google's outstanding capital stock and approximately 7.3% of the voting power of Google's outstanding capital stock.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include statements regarding our continued investments in our core areas of strategic focus, our expected SBC charges, and our plans to make significant capital expenditures. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, unforeseen changes in our hiring patterns and our need to expend capital to accommodate the growth of the business, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended

ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, free cash flow, and non-GAAP international revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.

FOUNDERS' LETTER 2012
Introduction
Throughout our evolution, from privately held start-up to large, publicly listed company, we have managed Google for the long termenjoying tremendous success as a result, especially since our IPO in 2004. Sergey and I hoped, though we did not expect, that Google would have such significant impact, and this progress has made us even more impatient to do important things that matter in the world. Our enduring love for Google comes from a strong desire to create technology products that enrich millions of people's lives in deep and meaningful ways. To fulfill these dreams, we need to ensure that Google remains a successful, growing business that can generate significant returns for everyone involved.
Corporate Structure
When we went public, we created a dual-class voting structure. Our goal was to maintain the freedom to focus on the long term by ensuring that the management team, in particular Eric, Sergey and I, retained control over Google's destiny. As we explained in our :
first founders' letter
"
We are creating a corporate structure that is designed for stability over long time horizons. By investing in Google, you are placing an unusual long term bet on the team, especially Sergey and me, and on our innovative approach
We want Google to become an important and significant institution. That takes time, stability and independence
In the transition to public ownership, we have set up a corporate structure that will make it harder for outside parties to take over or influence Google. This structure will also make it easier for our management team to follow the long term, innovative approach emphasized earlier
The main effect of this structure is likely to leave our team, especially Sergey and me, with increasingly significant control over the company's decisions and fate, as Google shares change hands
New investors will fully share in Google's long term economic future but will have little ability to influence its strategic decisions through their voting rights
Our colleagues will be able to trust that they themselves and their labors of hard work, love and creativity will be well cared for by a company focused on stability and the long term
"
As an investor, you are placing a potentially risky long term bet on the team, especially Sergey and me. . Sergey and I are committed to Google for the long term.
I wanted to quote all that because these were the clear, well-publicized expectations we established for investors in 2004. While this decision was controversial at the time, we believe with hindsight it was absolutely the right thing to do. Eight years later, these statements are still remarkably accurate, and everyone involved has realized tremendous benefits as a result. Given Google's success, it's unsurprising that this type of dual-class governance structure is now somewhat standard among newer technology companies.
In our experience, success is more likely if you concentrate on the long term. Technology products often require significant investment over many years to fulfill their potential. For example, it took over three years just to ship our first Android handset, and then another three years on top of that before the operating system truly reached critical mass. These kinds of investments are not for the faint-hearted.
We have protected Google from outside pressures and the temptation to sacrifice future opportunities to meet short-term demands. Long-term product investments, like Chrome and YouTube, which now enjoy phenomenal usage, were made with a significant degree of independence.
We have a structure that prevents outside parties from taking over or unduly influencing our management decisions. However, day-to-day dilution from routine equity-based employee compensation and other possible dilution, such as stock-based acquisitions, will likely undermine this dual-class structure and our aspirations for Google over the very long term. We have put our hearts into Google and hope to do so for many more years to come. So we want to ensure that our corporate structure can sustain these efforts and our desire to improve the world.
Effectively a Stock Split: And a New Class of Stock
Today we announced plans to create a new class of non-voting capital stock, which will be listed on NASDAQ. These shares will be distributed via a stock dividend to all existing stockholders: the owner of each existing share will receive one new share of the non-voting stock, giving investors twice the number of shares they had before. It's effectively a two-for-one stock splitsomething many of our investors have long asked us for. These non-voting shares will be available for corporate uses, like equity-based employee compensation, that might otherwise dilute our governance structure.
We recognize that some people, particularly those who opposed this structure at the start, won't support this changeand we understand that other companies have been very successful with more traditional governance models. But after careful consideration with our board of directors, we have decided that maintaining this founder-led approach is in the best interests of Google, our shareholders and our users. Having the flexibility to use stock without diluting our structure will help ensure we are set up for success for decades to come.
In November 2009, Sergey and I published plans to sell a modest percentage of our overall stock, ending in 2015. We are currently halfway through those plans and we don't expect any changes to that, certainly not as the result of this new potential class. We both remain very much committed to Google for the long term.
It's important to bear in mind that this proposal will only have an effect on governance over the very long term. In fact, there's no particular urgency to make these changes nowwe don't have an unusually big acquisition planned, in case you were wondering. It's just that since we know what we want to do, there's no reason to delay the decision. Also note that there will be no immediate change in votes, because everyone will still have the same number. In addition, Eric, Sergey and I have all agreed to "stapling" arrangements so that, above set thresholds, if our economic interest in Google were to decline, our votes would as well. We also have provisions to ensure all shareholders are treated fairly from an economic perspective.
For more details on all of this, please see the postscript below from our Chief Legal Officer, David Drummond, and the preliminary proxy statement we will file with the SEC next week.
Conclusion
We have always managed Google for the long term, investing heavily in the big bets we hope will make a significant difference in the world. Some of these bets have been tremendous, funding our activities and generating significant gains for our shareholders. Others have been less successful. But the ability to take these kinds of risks has been crucial to Google's overall success and we aim to maintain this pioneering culture going forward.
The proposal we announced today is consistent with the governance philosophy we articulated when we took the company public, as well as the trend for newer technology companies to adopt strong dual-class structures. We believe that it will provide great competitive strengthinsulating Google from short-term pressures, whatever the source, for a long time to come, while also giving us more flexibility around equity grants.
Investors and others have always taken a big bet on us, the founders, and that bet will likely last longer as a result of these changes. We are honored that so many of you have put your trust in us and we recognize the tremendous responsibility that rests on our shoulders. We think this is a good thing because users rely on Google to produce and operate amazing technology products and to safely and responsibly store their data. This is our passion.
Sergey and I share a profound belief in the potential for technology to improve people's lives and we are enormously excited about what lies ahead. I couldn't write a better conclusion to this founder's letter than what we wrote in 2004 so here goes: "."
We have a strong commitment to our users worldwide, their communities, the web sites in our network, our advertisers, our investors, and of course our employees. Sergey and I, and the team will do our best to make Google a long term success and the world a better place
 
April 2012
Postscript from David Drummond, Chief Legal Officer, Google Inc.
This is not the usual yada yada so please read on.
Although we'll be filing a comprehensive proxy statement soon, I wanted to share some details about today's proposal to create a new class of stock and the process our board of directors followed to approve it.
As Larry and Sergey note above, the stock dividend we are announcing today will have the basic effect of a two-for-one stock split. Each holder of a share of Class A or Class B common stock will receive one share of the new non-voting Class C capital stock. So after the dividend, a stockholder who currently owns one Class A share with a single vote will continue to own that share plus one Class C share without a vote.
The Class A shares will continue to trade under the "GOOG" ticker symbol, while the Class C shares will trade under a different ticker symbol, so stockholders will be able to trade these shares, just as they can with Class A shares today. Except for voting rights, the Class C shares will have the same rights as the existing Class A and Class B shares. As is typically the case with stock splits, the Class C stock dividend will be tax-free.
One thing to keep in mind is that immediately after the Class C dividend, all stockholders, including Larry, Sergey and Eric, will retain the same voting interest they hold prior to the dividend. In addition, Larry, Sergey and Eric have agreed to subject their shares to a Transfer Restriction Agreement. This agreement will maintain the same link between their voting and economic interests that exists today, even if they sell some of their non-voting Class C shares. If the founders or Eric wish to sell or transfer their non-voting Class C shares, a "stapling" provision in the agreement requires them to either sell an equal number of Class B shares, or convert an equal number of Class B shares into Class A shares. No other stockholders will be subject to these restrictions upon the transfer or sale of their shares. The stapling requirement will terminate as to the founders when their collective ownership falls below a certain threshold, and as to Eric when his ownership falls below a certain threshold. Further details of the Transfer Restriction Agreement will be included in our proxy, but it's important to note that the stapling provision is designed so that, subject to the thresholds, the votes held by the founders and Eric will be reduced proportionally as their economic interest in the company declines.
Our board of directors carefully considered this proposal to create a new class of stock before reaching a decision. In January 2011, the board established a special committee, comprised of independent, non-management board members to consider a new class of stock, or other alternatives. This committee retained its own financial and legal advisers to assist with its deliberations, and met on numerous occasions over the 15 months that the special committee considered the proposal separately from the board. The committee recommended, and the board unanimously approved, today's proposal.
The proposal is subject to the approval of a majority of the voting power of Google's common stock, voting together as a single class, at our annual meeting on June 21, 2012. Given that Larry, Sergey, and Eric control the majority of voting power and support this proposal, we expect it to pass. The Board of Directors has not set a record date for the issuance of the Class C dividend and currently expects to set the date following the annual meeting.
Next week, we'll file a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC, which will contain further details regarding today's proposal.

Exhibit 99.4
Basics
How is this different from what we have today?
Currently, Googlers hold two types of stock: (1) Class A stock, which has one vote per share (this is the type of stock that most Googlers hold in GSUs and stock options), and (2) Class B stock, which has 10 votes per share (the vast majority of which is held by Larry, Sergey and Eric). Currently, the equity grants we make to employees (e.g. new hire and equity refresh grants) are based in Class A shares. If the proposal is approved, we'll have three types of stock  Class A stock and Class B stock, which retain their voting rights, and a new Class C stock, which would have no voting rights. In general, going forward, all employee equity award grants are expected to be issued in Class C stock.
What does this mean if I have unvested GSUs? What about the vesting schedule?
For each unvested Class A GSU you own, you would receive an additional unvested GSU that covers one share of Class C stock. So after the stock dividend, you would have one unvested GSU that covers one share of Class A stock and one unvested GSU that covers one share of Class C stock.
What about the vesting schedule?
Your vesting schedule would remain the same. When a GSU covering a Class A share vests, the corresponding GSU covering a Class C share would also vest.
 
What would happen to my vested, unexercised options?
We expect that for each vested, unexercised option you have, you will receive a vested unexercised Class C stock option. So, after the stock dividend for each Class A share, you would have one vested unexercised Class A option and one vested unexercised Class C option. The strike price of your Class A and Class C options would be adjusted, based on the original strike price of your Class A options (prior to the stock dividend) and the trading price of the ClassA and Class C stock following the issuance of the stock dividend. We will provide more detail on the calculation of the adjusted strike price before the dividend date.
 
How will this affect 2012 Equity Refresh planning and grants?
The 2012 Equity Refresh program is scheduled prior to the anticipated dividend distribution date. If you receive a Refresh grant, the GSUs and/or options granted to you as part of the Refresh grant will be adjusted to account for the Class C dividend as described above. Please make sure you accept your 2012 Refresh grant as soon as possible after it is made.
 
NOTE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

General
What is happening?
Google is proposing to create a new class of non-voting stock (Class C), in addition to the current voting Class A and Class B stock. If the proposal is approved, it would be effected through the issuance of a stock dividend for all outstanding Google Class A and Class B shares. Each stockholder would receive a share of Class C stock for each share of Class A and Class B stock they hold as of a specified dividend record date. The record date will be announced once all required approvals have been obtained.
The fundamentals of our business are unchanged by this proposal. This is effectively a stock split  people who previously had one share would have two shares in what we expect would be very liquid markets. Class A shares would retain one stockholder vote per share. Class C shares would not have any voting rights. The Class A and Class C shares would be traded under different ticker symbols and their prices may vary over time.
See the examples below:

A dividend? Does this mean we're getting cash?
No, if the proposal is approved, the dividend will be issued in shares of Class C stock.
So how does this work?
If stockholders approve the proposal, this will effectively be a stock split  people who previously had one share will have two shares. The Class A stock and Class C stock would be traded under different ticker symbols and their prices may vary over time.
Why are we doing this?
Check out this year's Founders' Letter on the Investor Relations site for more information about this proposal.
Who came up with this proposal?
The Board established a Special Committee, comprised of independent, non-management Board members, in January 2011 to consider creating a new class of stock and other alternatives. This Committee retained its own financial and legal advisers to assist it in its deliberations and met on numerous occasions over the 15 months that the Special Committee considered the proposal separately from the Board. The Committee recommended, and the Board unanimously approved, this proposal.
Who has to approve this proposal?
The proposal to create a new Class C stock is subject to stockholder approval at our annual meeting in June. Given that Larry, Sergey, and Eric control the majority of voting power and support this proposal, we expect it to pass.
Since this new class doesn't carry any voting rights, what's to keep Larry/Sergey/Eric from selling all of their new non-voting (Class C) shares while maintaining voting control of the company?
As part of this proposal, Larry, Sergey, and Eric have agreed to a Transfer Restriction Agreement on their sales of the new Class C stock. See our site for more details.
Investor Relations
What is the timeline for the changes?
The proposal to create a new Class C stock must be approved by a stockholder vote at the annual stockholder meeting on June 21, 2012. Once that vote has occurred, we'll follow up with more information about the implementation timeline.
Who would this change apply to?
If approved, the proposal would apply to all stockholders who own Class A or Class B stock and all employees, consultants and directors who have unvested Google Stock Units (GSUs) and/or vested or unvested stock options as of a date to be set by the Board. If the proposal is approved, we intend that future equity grants after this date would be made in Class C shares.
What do I need to do?
Please log in to your brokerage account on either (MSSB) or and verify that you have accepted all of your existing grants. As long as you have done this, the administration of the stock dividend would happen automatically through your brokerage account.

Exhibit 99.3
FOUNDERS' LETTER 2012
Introduction
Throughout our evolution, from privately held start-up to large, publicly listed company, we have managed Google for the long termenjoying tremendous success as a result, especially since our IPO in 2004. Sergey and I hoped, though we did not expect, that Google would have such significant impact, and this progress has made us even more impatient to do important things that matter in the world. Our enduring love for Google comes from a strong desire to create technology products that enrich millions of people's lives in deep and meaningful ways. To fulfill these dreams, we need to ensure that Google remains a successful, growing business that can generate significant returns for everyone involved.
Corporate Structure
When we went public, we created a dual-class voting structure. Our goal was to maintain the freedom to focus on the long term by ensuring that the management team, in particular Eric, Sergey and I, retained control over Google's destiny. As we explained in our :
first founders' letter
"
We are creating a corporate structure that is designed for stability over long time horizons. By investing in Google, you are placing an unusual long term bet on the team, especially Sergey and me, and on our innovative approach
We want Google to become an important and significant institution. That takes time, stability and independence
In the transition to public ownership, we have set up a corporate structure that will make it harder for outside parties to take over or influence Google. This structure will also make it easier for our management team to follow the long term, innovative approach emphasized earlier
The main effect of this structure is likely to leave our team, especially Sergey and me, with increasingly significant control over the company's decisions and fate, as Google shares change hands
New investors will fully share in Google's long term economic future but will have little ability to influence its strategic decisions through their voting rights
Our colleagues will be able to trust that they themselves and their labors of hard work, love and creativity will be well cared for by a company focused on stability and the long term
"
As an investor, you are placing a potentially risky long term bet on the team, especially Sergey and me. . Sergey and I are committed to Google for the long term.
I wanted to quote all that because these were the clear, well-publicized expectations we established for investors in 2004. While this decision was controversial at the time, we believe with hindsight it was absolutely the right thing to do. Eight years later, these statements are still remarkably accurate, and everyone involved has realized tremendous benefits as a result. Given Google's success, it's unsurprising that this type of dual-class governance structure is now somewhat standard among newer technology companies.
In our experience, success is more likely if you concentrate on the long term. Technology products often require significant investment over many years to fulfill their potential. For example, it took over three years just to ship our first Android handset, and then another three years on top of that before the operating system truly reached critical mass. These kinds of investments are not for the faint-hearted.
We have protected Google from outside pressures and the temptation to sacrifice future opportunities to meet short-term demands. Long-term product investments, like Chrome and YouTube, which now enjoy phenomenal usage, were made with a significant degree of independence.
We have a structure that prevents outside parties from taking over or unduly influencing our management decisions. However, day-to-day dilution from routine equity-based employee compensation and other possible dilution, such as stock-based acquisitions, will likely undermine this dual-class structure and our aspirations for Google over the very long term. We have put our hearts into Google and hope to do so for many more years to come. So we want to ensure that our corporate structure can sustain these efforts and our desire to improve the world.
Effectively a Stock Split: And a New Class of Stock
Today we announced plans to create a new class of non-voting capital stock, which will be listed on NASDAQ. These shares will be distributed via a stock dividend to all existing stockholders: the owner of each existing share will receive one new share of the non-voting stock, giving investors twice the number of shares they had before. It's effectively a two-for-one stock splitsomething many of our investors have long asked us for. These non-voting shares will be available for corporate uses, like equity-based employee compensation, that might otherwise dilute our governance structure.
We recognize that some people, particularly those who opposed this structure at the start, won't support this changeand we understand that other companies have been very successful with more traditional governance models. But after careful consideration with our board of directors, we have decided that maintaining this founder-led approach is in the best interests of Google, our shareholders and our users. Having the flexibility to use stock without diluting our structure will help ensure we are set up for success for decades to come.
In November 2009, Sergey and I published plans to sell a modest percentage of our overall stock, ending in 2015. We are currently halfway through those plans and we don't expect any changes to that, certainly not as the result of this new potential class. We both remain very much committed to Google for the long term.
It's important to bear in mind that this proposal will only have an effect on governance over the very long term. In fact, there's no particular urgency to make these changes nowwe don't have an unusually big acquisition planned, in case you were wondering. It's just that since we know what we want to do, there's no reason to delay the decision. Also note that there will be no immediate change in votes, because everyone will still have the same number. In addition, Eric, Sergey and I have all agreed to "stapling" arrangements so that, above set thresholds, if our economic interest in Google were to decline, our votes would as well. We also have provisions to ensure all shareholders are treated fairly from an economic perspective.
For more details on all of this, please see the postscript below from our Chief Legal Officer, David Drummond, and the preliminary proxy statement we will file with the SEC next week.
Conclusion
We have always managed Google for the long term, investing heavily in the big bets we hope will make a significant difference in the world. Some of these bets have been tremendous, funding our activities and generating significant gains for our shareholders. Others have been less successful. But the ability to take these kinds of risks has been crucial to Google's overall success and we aim to maintain this pioneering culture going forward.
The proposal we announced today is consistent with the governance philosophy we articulated when we took the company public, as well as the trend for newer technology companies to adopt strong dual-class structures. We believe that it will provide great competitive strengthinsulating Google from short-term pressures, whatever the source, for a long time to come, while also giving us more flexibility around equity grants.
Investors and others have always taken a big bet on us, the founders, and that bet will likely last longer as a result of these changes. We are honored that so many of you have put your trust in us and we recognize the tremendous responsibility that rests on our shoulders. We think this is a good thing because users rely on Google to produce and operate amazing technology products and to safely and responsibly store their data. This is our passion.
Sergey and I share a profound belief in the potential for technology to improve people's lives and we are enormously excited about what lies ahead. I couldn't write a better conclusion to this founder's letter than what we wrote in 2004 so here goes: "."
We have a strong commitment to our users worldwide, their communities, the web sites in our network, our advertisers, our investors, and of course our employees. Sergey and I, and the team will do our best to make Google a long term success and the world a better place

Postscript from David Drummond, Chief Legal Officer, Google Inc.
This is not the usual yada yada so please read on.
Although we'll be filing a comprehensive proxy statement soon, I wanted to share some details about today's proposal to create a new class of stock and the process our board of directors followed to approve it.
As Larry and Sergey note above, the stock dividend we are announcing today will have the basic effect of a two-for-one stock split. Each holder of a share of Class A or Class B common stock will receive one share of the new non-voting Class C capital stock. So after the dividend, a stockholder who currently owns one Class A share with a single vote will continue to own that share plus one Class C share without a vote.
The Class A shares will continue to trade under the "GOOG" ticker symbol, while the Class C shares will trade under a different ticker symbol, so stockholders will be able to trade these shares, just as they can with Class A shares today. Except for voting rights, the Class C shares will have the same rights as the existing Class A and Class B shares. As is typically the case with stock splits, the Class C stock dividend will be tax-free.
One thing to keep in mind is that immediately after the Class C dividend, all stockholders, including Larry, Sergey and Eric, will retain the same voting interest they hold prior to the dividend. In addition, Larry, Sergey and Eric have agreed to subject their shares to a Transfer Restriction Agreement. This agreement will maintain the same link between their voting and economic interests that exists today, even if they sell some of their non-voting Class C shares. If the founders or Eric wish to sell or transfer their non-voting Class C shares, a "stapling" provision in the agreement requires them to either sell an equal number of Class B shares, or convert an equal number of Class B shares into Class A shares. No other stockholders will be subject to these restrictions upon the transfer or sale of their shares. The stapling requirement will terminate as to the founders when their collective ownership falls below a certain threshold, and as to Eric when his ownership falls below a certain threshold. Further details of the Transfer Restriction Agreement will be included in our proxy, but it's important to note that the stapling provision is designed so that, subject to the thresholds, the votes held by the founders and Eric will be reduced proportionally as their economic interest in the company declines.
Our board of directors carefully considered this proposal to create a new class of stock before reaching a decision. In January 2011, the board established a special committee, comprised of independent, non-management board members to consider a new class of stock, or other alternatives. This committee retained its own financial and legal advisers to assist with its deliberations, and met on numerous occasions over the 15 months that the special committee considered the proposal separately from the board. The committee recommended, and the board unanimously approved, today's proposal.
The proposal is subject to the approval of a majority of the voting power of Google's common stock, voting together as a single class, at our annual meeting on June 21, 2012. Given that Larry, Sergey, and Eric control the majority of voting power and support this proposal, we expect it to pass. The Board of Directors has not set a record date for the issuance of the Class C dividend and currently expects to set the date following the annual meeting.
Next week, we'll file a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC, which will contain further details regarding today's proposal.

Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
 
 
On May 22, 2012, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 15, 2011 (the Merger Agreement), by and among Google Inc. (the Company), RB98 Inc. (Merger Sub) and Motorola Mobility Holdings, Inc. (Motorola Mobility), the Company completed the acquisition of Motorola Mobility through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Motorola Mobility, with Motorola Mobility continuing as the surviving corporation (the Merger). As a result of the Merger, Motorola Mobility became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and each share of Motorola Mobilitys common stock, par value $0.01 per share, other than shares owned directly or indirectly by the Company or Merger Sub or held by Motorola Mobility as treasury stock immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger and shares held by stockholders that have properly exercised their appraisal rights in accordance with Delaware law, was canceled and converted into the right to receive $40.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable tax withholdings.  Based on the aggregate number, immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, of the (A) shares of Motorola Mobility common stock, (B) options to purchase shares of Motorola Mobility common stock with exercise prices less than $40.00, and (C) other Motorola Mobility stock-based awards, the total purchase price was approximately $12.9 billion, assuming all unvested equity awards vest.  The increase in the estimated total purchase price (from the original estimate of approximately $12.5 billion) was related primarily to issuances of additional equity awards since the date of execution of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms.  The foregoing description does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Merger Agreement filed herewith as Exhibit 2.1, which is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The Merger Agreement has been included to provide investors and security holders with information regarding its terms.  It is not intended to provide any other factual information about the Company, Motorola Mobility, Merger Sub or their respective subsidiaries and affiliates.  The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties by the Company and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and by Motorola Mobility, on the other hand, made solely for the benefit of the other.  The assertions embodied in those representations and warranties are qualified by information in a confidential disclosure letter delivered in connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement.  The disclosure letter contains information that has been included in the Motorola Mobilitys general prior public disclosures, as well as potential additional non-public information.  The disclosure letter contains information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties set forth in the Merger Agreement.  Moreover, certain representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement were made as of a specified date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from what might be viewed as material to shareholders, or may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk between the Company and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and by Motorola Mobility, on the other hand.  Accordingly, the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement should not be relied on by any persons as characterizations of the actual state of facts about the Company, Merger Sub or Motorola Mobility at the time they were made or otherwise.  In addition, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Companys public disclosures.

Sanjay Jha, who was responsible for building the company and placing a big bet on Android, has stepped down as CEO.  I would like to thank him for his efforts and am tremendously pleased that he will be working to ensure a smooth transition as long-time Googler Dennis Woodside takes over as CEO of Motorola Mobility.
Ive known Dennis for nearly a decade, and hes been phenomenal at building teams and delivering on some of Googles biggest bets.
Dennis has always been a committed partner to our customers and I know he will be an outstanding leader of Motorola--and hes already off to great start with some very strong new hires for the Motorola team.
Dennis Woodside, CEO of Motorola Mobility, said: Motorola literally invented the entire mobile industry with the first-ever commercial cell phone in 1983. Thirty years later, mobile devices are at the center of the computing revolution.
Our aim is simple: to focus Motorola Mobilitys remarkable talent on fewer, bigger bets, and create wonderful devices that are used by people around the world.
Dennis Woodside has hired a small number of leaders who will immediately join Motorolas executive team, including Regina Dugan (former Director of DARPA), Mark Randall (former supply chain VP at Amazon and previously at Nokia), Vanessa Wittman (former CFO of Marsh & McLennan), Scott Sullivan (former head of HR at Visa and NVIDIA), and Gary Briggs (former Google VP of Consumer Marketing).  In addition to these new leaders, many members of Motorola Mobilitys team will continue in their current roles:  Iqbal Arshad (Product Development), Marshall Brown (Chief of Staff), Fei Liu (Mass Market Products), Dan Moloney (Home), Scott Offer (General Counsel), Mark Shockley (Sales), Mahesh Veerina (Software & Enterprise)  and Jim Wicks (Consumer Experience Design).
Woodside added: Motorola Mobility has many outstanding leaders, including people who were behind the original RAZR in 2004 and recent successes like the Droid and RAZR MAXX. Our colleagues joining the team come from varied backgrounds, from DARPA to Amazon and NVIDIA, but they all share a track record of leading innovation at speed, and a great deal of excitement about the mission ahead.

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
ITEM 1A.                      RISK FACTORS
 
Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our Class A common stock.
 
Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
 
We face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, we may not remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected.
 
Our business is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and is subject to changing technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services.  Our ability to compete successfully depends heavily on providing products and services that make using the internet a more useful and enjoyable experience for our users and delivering innovative products and technologies to the marketplace.  With our acquisition of Motorola Mobility Holdings, Inc. (Motorola), the competitive pressure to innovate will now encompass a wider range of products and services, including products and services that may be outside of our historical core business.
 
We have many competitors in different industries, including general purpose search engines, vertical search engines and e-commerce sites, social networking sites, traditional media companies, wireless mobile device companies, and providers of online products and services.  Our current and potential competitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Established companies have longer operating histories and more established relationships with customers and users, and they can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions, investing aggressively in research and development, aggressively initiating intellectual property claims (whether or not meritorious) and competing aggressively for advertisers and websites. Emerging start-ups may be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can.
 
Our competitors are constantly developing innovations in web search, online advertising, wireless mobile devices, and web-based products and services. The research and development of new, technologically advanced products is also a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and investment, as well as the accurate anticipation of technology, market trends and consumer needs. As a result, we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our web search technology and our existing products and services, and introduce new products and services that people can easily and effectively use. If we are unable to provide quality products and services, then acceptance rates for our products and services could decline and affect consumer and advertiser perceptions of our brand. In addition, these new products and services may present new and difficult technological and legal challenges, and we may be subject to claims if users of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other issues. Our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our users, advertisers, and Google Network Members, are not appropriately timed with market opportunities, or are not effectively brought to market. As technology continues to develop, our competitors may be able to offer user experiences that are, or that are seen to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. This may force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources in order to remain competitive. If our competitors are more successful than we are in developing compelling products or in attracting and retaining users, advertisers, and content providers, our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected.
 
 
 
 
Our ongoing investment in new business strategies and new products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and could disrupt our ongoing businesses.
 
We have invested and expect to continue to invest in new business strategies, products, services, and technologies. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenues to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments, inadequate return of capital on our investments, and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence of such strategies and offerings. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.
 
Acquisitions and investments could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.
 
Acquisitions are an important element of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital, and we expect our current pace of acquisitions to continue. These transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. We also expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions. The process of integrating an acquired company, business, or technology has created, and will continue to create, unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The areas where we face risks include:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally.
 
Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition or results. Also, the anticipated benefit of many of our acquisitions may not materialize.
 
 
 
 
We generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising, and the reduction in spending by or loss of advertisers could seriously harm our business.
 
We generated 96% of Google revenues in 2011 and in the three months ended March 31, 2012 from our advertisers. Following our acquisition of Motorola, we still expect a significant portion of our revenues to come from advertising. Our advertisers can generally terminate their contracts with us at any time. Advertisers will not continue to do business with us if their investment in advertising with us does not generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, or if we do not deliver their advertisements in an appropriate and effective manner. If we are unable to remain competitive and provide value to our advertisers, they may stop placing ads with us, which would adversely affect our revenues and business.
 
In addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns. Adverse macroeconomic conditions can also have a material negative impact on the demand for advertising and cause our advertisers to reduce the amounts they spend on advertising, which could adversely affect our revenues and business.
 
Our revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future.
 
Our revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition, changes in our product mix, query growth rates and how consumers make queries, the challenges in maintaining our growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels, the increasing maturity of the online advertising market and the other markets in which we participate and the success of our investments in new business strategies, products, services, and technologies, such as our acquisition of Motorola.
 
The revenue growth rate of our Motorola business will also depend on a number of factors, including our reliance on several large customers, the absence of Motorolas Any of these factors could have a Motorolas
long-term exclusivity arrangements with such customers, our ability to gain significant market share in the mobile devices space, our reliance on third-party distributors, representatives and retailers to sell certain of its products and the successful implementation of our product and operating system strategies. Furthermore, industry consolidation in the telecommunications and cable industries could negatively impact
business because there would be fewer network operators and it could be more difficult to replace any lost customers.
negative impact on
business and have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results.
 
We believe our operating margin will experience downward pressure as a result of increasing competition and increased expenditures for many aspects of our business, including Motorola. For instance, our operating margin will experience downward pressure if a greater percentage of our revenues comes from ads placed on our Google Network Members websites compared to revenues generated through ads placed on our own websites or if we spend a proportionately larger amount to promote the distribution of certain products, including Google Chrome.
Both the margin on revenues we generate from our Google Network Members and the margin on revenues from our Motorola business is significantly less than the margin on revenues we generate from advertising on our websites. Also, the margins on advertising revenues from mobile devices and newer advertising formats are generally less than the margin on revenues we generate from advertising on our websites. Additionally, the margin we earn on revenues generated from our Google Network Members could decrease in the future if we pay an even larger percentage of advertising fees to our Google Network Members.
 
We are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny that may negatively impact our business.
 
The growth of our company and our expansion into a variety of new fields implicate a variety of new regulatory issues, and we have experienced increased regulatory scrutiny as we have grown. In particular, we are cooperating with the regulatory authorities in the United States and abroad, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the European Commission (EC), and several state attorneys general in investigations they are conducting with respect to our business and its impact on competition. Legislators and regulators, including those conducting investigations in the U.S. and Europe, may make legal and regulatory changes, or interpret and apply existing laws, in ways that make our products and services less useful to our users, require us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil or criminal liability, or cause us to change our business practices. These changes or increased costs could negatively impact our business and results of operations in material ways.
 
 
 
 
We are regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.
 
We are regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust (such as the pending investigations by the FTC and the EC), intellectual property, privacy, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, and other matters. Our acquisition of Motorola also exposes us to the risk of product liability and other litigation involving . In addition, our Motorola business faces intellectual property litigation, as further discussed later, that exposes us to the risk of exclusion and cease and desist orders, which could limit our ability to sell Motorola products.
assertions about product defects, as well as health and safety, hazardous materials usage, and other environmental concerns
 
Such claims, suits, government investigations, and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, such legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires significant judgment. It is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in a particular period. These proceedings could also result in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, requiring a change in our business practices or product recalls or other field action, or requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies.  Any of these consequences could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
 
Our business depends on a strong brand, and failing to maintain and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to expand our base of users, advertisers, Google Network Members, and other partners.
 
The brand identity that we have developed has significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the Google brand is critical to expanding our base of users, advertisers, Google Network Members, and other partners. We believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase due to the relatively low barriers to entry in the internet market. Our brand may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including data protection and security issues, service outages, and product malfunctions. If we fail to maintain and enhance the Google brand, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, operating results, and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. Maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to be a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality innovative products and services, which we may not do successfully.
 
A variety of new and existing U.S. and foreign laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.
 
We are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. New laws and regulations (or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations) may also impact our business. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties.
 
 
 
 
Furthermore, many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies. The laws that do reference the internet are being interpreted by the courts, but their applicability and scope remain uncertain. For example, the laws relating to the liability of providers of online services are currently unsettled both within the U.S. and abroad. Claims have also been, or may be, threatened and filed against us under both U.S. and foreign laws for defamation, invasion of privacy and other tort claims, unlawful activity, patent, copyright and trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched and the ads posted by our users, our products and services, or content generated by our users. Moreover, recent amendments to U.S. patent laws will become effective in 2012 and may affect our ability to protect our innovations and defend against claims of patent infringement.
 
In addition, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has provisions that limit, but do not necessarily eliminate, our liability for caching or hosting, or for listing or linking to, third-party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights, so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act. Any future legislation impacting these safe harbors may adversely impact us. Various U.S. and international laws restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors. In the area of data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as Californias Information Practices Act. We face similar risks and costs as our products and services are offered in international markets and may be subject to additional regulations.
 
We are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property or other claims, which are costly to defend, could result in significant damage awards, and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.
 
Internet, technology, and media companies own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies may continue to seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. As we have grown, the intellectual property rights claims against us have increased and may continue to increase as we develop new products, services, and technologies.
 
We have had patent, copyright, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies, including Android, Google Search, Google AdWords, Google AdSense, Motorola, Google Books, Google News, Google Image Search, Google Chrome, Google Talk, Google Voice, and YouTube, infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Adverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, and may also cause us to change our business practices, and require development of non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business.
Third parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against Motorola by filing claims in the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease and desist orders, which could limit our ability to sell Motorola products in the U.S. or elsewhere if our products or those of our customers or suppliers are found to infringe the intellectual property subject to the claims.  
 
In addition, many of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which could increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business. Moreover, supplier provided intellectual property indemnities to us, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers from malfunctioning products.
 
 
 
 
Regardless of the merits of the claims, intellectual property claims are often time consuming, expensive to litigate or settle, and cause significant diversion of management attention. To the extent such intellectual property infringement claims are successful, they may have an adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
 
Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and brand.
 
Our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, services and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective.
 
Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, because of our long-term interests in open source, we may not have adequate patent protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.
 
We also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy could be compromised by outside parties, or by our employees, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets.
 
We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word Google could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word search. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the word Google to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand.
 
Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.
 
We may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online services or content.
 
We host and provide a wide variety of services and products that enable users to exchange information, advertise products and services, conduct business, and engage in various online activities both domestically and internationally. The law relating to the liability of providers of these online services and products for activities of their users is still somewhat unsettled both within the U.S. and internationally. Claims have been threatened and have been brought against us for defamation, negligence, breaches of contract, copyright or trademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity, tort, including personal injury, fraud, or other theories based on the nature and content of information which we publish or to which we provide links or that may be posted online or generated by us or by third parties, including our users. In addition, we are and have been and may again in the future be subject to domestic or international actions alleging that certain content we have generated or third-party content that we have made available within our services violates laws in domestic and international jurisdictions.
 
We also arrange for the distribution of third-party advertisements to third-party publishers and advertising networks, and we offer third-party products, services, or content. We may be subject to claims concerning these products, services, or content by virtue of our involvement in marketing, branding, broadcasting, or providing access to them, even if we do not ourselves host, operate, provide, or provide access to these products, services, or content. Defense of any such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources, may result in monetary liabilities or penalties, and may require us to change our business in an adverse manner.
 
 
 
 
More people are using devices other than personal computers to access the internet. If users do not widely adopt versions of our web search technology, products, or operating systems developed for these devices, our business could be adversely affected.
 
The number of people who access the internet through devices other than personal computers, including mobile phones, smartphones, handheld computers such as netbooks and tablets, video game consoles, and television set-top devices, has increased dramatically in the past few years. The lower resolution, functionality, and memory associated with some alternative devices make the use of our products and services through such devices more difficult and the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users, manufacturers, or distributors of alternative devices. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not work or be viewable on these devices as a result. As new devices and new platforms are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our products and services for use on these alternative devices and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of such devices. If we are unable to attract and retain a substantial number of alternative device manufacturers, distributors, and users to our products and services, or if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are more compatible with alternative devices, we will fail to capture a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online services, which could adversely affect our business.
 
Privacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and services.
 
From time to time, concerns have been expressed by regulators and others about whether our products, services, or processes compromise the privacy of users and others. Concerns about, or regulatory actions involving our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect operating results. While we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies, the failure or perceived failure to comply may result, and in some cases has resulted, in inquiries and other proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, or could cause us to lose users and customers, which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.
 
In addition, as nearly all of our products and services are web-based, the amount of data we store for our users on our servers (including personal information) has been increasing. Any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the release of our users data could seriously limit the adoption of our products and services, as well as harm our reputation and brand and, therefore, our business. We expect to continue to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of web-based products and services we offer, and operate in more countries.
 
Regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.
 
 
 
 
With our acquisition of Motorola, we face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that, if not properly managed, could adversely impact our financial results and prospects.
 
With our acquisition of Motorola, we face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management. For instance,
the products we sell may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the product, or from the software used in the product. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers. If the quality of our Motorola products does not meet our customers expectations or our products are found to be defective, then our sales and operating earnings, and ultimately our reputation, could be negatively impacted.
 
rely on third parties to manufacture many of Motorolas assemblies and finished products, and we have third-party arrangements for the design of some components and parts. Our Motorola business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other materials terms of our arrangements with them
We
.
 
Motorola, like many electronics manufacturers, has also experienced supply shortages and price increases in the past driven by raw material availability, manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, natural disasters and significant changes in the financial or business condition of its suppliers.  Workaround plans to address shortages have entailed in the past, and could entail in the future, increased freight costs for expedited shipments.  We cannot assure you that we will not experience shortages or other supply chain disruptions in the future or that they will not negatively impact our operations.  In addition, some of the components we use in our Motorola products are available only from a single source or limited sources, and we cannot assure you that we would be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms or at all in the event of a supply chain disruption.
 
Additionally, because many of our supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements, if the volume of our Motorola sales decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs or other financial liabilities that could make our Motorola products more costly per unit to manufacture and therefore less competitive and negatively impact our financial results. Further, certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may impact our supply.
 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act included disclosure requirements regarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries (DRC) and procedures regarding a manufacturers efforts to prevent the sourcing of such conflict minerals. While final rules are not yet implemented, these rules could limit the pool of suppliers who can provide us DRC conflict free components and parts, and we may not be able to obtain DRC conflict free products or supplies in sufficient quantities for our operations. Also, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the conflict minerals used in our products.
 
If our security measures are breached, or if our services are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our products and services, our products and services may be perceived as not being secure, users and customers may curtail or stop using our products and services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.
 
Our products and services involve the storage and transmission of users and customers proprietary information, and security breaches expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation, and potential liability. We experience cyber attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis, and as a result, unauthorized parties have obtained, and may in the future obtain, access to our data or our users or customers data. Our security measures may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise.  Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, users, or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our users or customers data. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users and customers.
 
 
 
 
Web spam and content farms could decrease our search quality, which could damage our reputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services.
 
Web spam refers to websites that attempt to violate a search engines quality guidelines or that otherwise seek to rank higher in search results than a search engines assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Although English-language web spam in our search results has been significantly reduced, and web spam in most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek ways to improve their rankings inappropriately. We continuously combat web spam, including through indexing technology that makes it harder for spam-like, less useful web content to rank highly. We have also improved our ability to detect hacked websites, a major source of web spam in 2010. We face challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites, including content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improve their search rankings. In 2011, we launched several algorithmic changes focused on low-quality websites. If web spam and content farms continue to increase on Google, this could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce user traffic to our websites. In addition, as we continue to take actions to improve our search quality and reduce low-quality content, this may in the short run reduce our AdSense revenues, since some of these websites are AdSense partners.
 
Interruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results.
 
The availability of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks, or other attempts to harm our systems. Some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and to potential disruptions if the operators of these facilities have financial difficulties. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster, a decision to close a facility we are using without adequate notice for financial reasons, or other unanticipated problems at our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and may contain errors or vulnerabilities. Any errors or vulnerabilities in our products and services, or damage to or failure of our systems, could result in interruptions in our services, which could reduce our revenues and profits, and damage our brand.
 
Our international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.
 
Our international operations are significant to our revenues and net income, and we plan to further expand internationally. International revenues accounted for approximately 54% of our total Google revenues in 2011 and in the three months ended March 31, 2012, and more than half of our user traffic has been coming from outside the U.S. In certain international markets, we have limited operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed.
 
 
 
 
Our Motorola business also has many manufacturing, research and development, administrative and sales facilities outside the U.S., and more than half of our Motorola employees are employed outside the U.S. Most of our Motorola suppliers operations are outside the U.S. and nearly all of our Motorola products (other than some prototypes) are manufactured outside the U.S., primarily in China, Taiwan and Brazil.
If our manufacturing in these regions is disrupted, our overall capacity could be significantly reduced and sales or profitability could be negatively impacted. We require these suppliers and business partners to operate in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and company policies regarding workplace and employment practices, environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing, but we do not control them or their practices. If one of these suppliers or business partners violates labor or other laws or implements practices that are regarded as unethical, we could experience supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, terminations of or damage to key relationships, and damage to our reputation. If one of our suppliers or business partners fails to procure necessary license rights to third-party intellectual property, legal action could ensue that could impact the salability of our products and expose us to financial obligations to third parties. Any of these events could have a negative impact on our financial results and prospects.
 
Moreover, in connection with our operations in Brazil, we have had and continue to have legal disputes and controversies, including tax, labor and trade compliance controversies and other legal matters that take many years to resolve. We incur legal and other costs in managing and defending these matters and expect to continue to incur such costs. Based on our assessment of these matters, we have recorded reserves on only a small portion of the total potential exposure. It is, however, very difficult to predict the outcome of legal disputes and controversies, including litigation, in Brazil and our ultimate exposure may be greater than our current assessments and related reserves.
 
In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include internal control and disclosure rules, data privacy and filtering requirements, anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and antitrust and competition regulations, among others. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.
 
Furthermore,
our Motorola business has had, and continues to have, a policy requiring our suppliers, business partners and customers to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations and Motorolas code of business conduct regarding working conditions, employment practices, environmental compliance and trademark and copyright licensing. However, we do not control their labor and other business practices. If one of our suppliers violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are regarded as unethical, the shipment of finished products to us could be interrupted, orders could be canceled, relationships could be terminated and our reputation could be damaged. If one of our suppliers fails to procure necessary license rights to trademarks, copyrights or patents owned by third parties, legal action could be taken against us that could impact the salability of our products and expose us to financial obligations to third parties. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations and harm our brand.
 
Finally, since we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our net income. Additionally, hedging programs are inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
 
If we were to lose the services of Larry, Sergey, Eric, or other key personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy.
 
Our future success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. In particular, Larry Page and Sergey Brin are critical to the overall management of Google and the development of our technology. Along with our Executive Chairman Eric E. Schmidt, they also play a key role in maintaining our culture and setting our strategic direction. All of our executive officers and key employees are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies. The loss of key personnel could seriously harm our business.
 
We rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, or maintain our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow effectively.
 
Our performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense, and certain of our competitors have directly targeted our employees. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees.
 
 
 
 
In addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization grows, and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. This could negatively impact our future success.
 
Our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet by us and our users. Internet access providers may be able to block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.
 
Our products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the internet, and certain of our products require significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers have taken, or have stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, or by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings. Such interference could result in a loss of existing users and advertisers, and increased costs, and could impair our ability to attract new users and advertisers, thereby harming our revenues and growth.
 
New technologies could block our ads, which would harm our business.
 
Technologies have been developed (including by us) that can block the display of our ads and that provide tools to users to opt out of our advertising products. Most of our revenues are derived from fees paid to us by advertisers in connection with the display of ads on web pages for our users. As a result, such technologies and tools could adversely affect our operating results.
 
We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio.
 
Given the global nature of our business, we have investments both domestically and internationally. Credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, financial results, or other factors. As a result, the value or liquidity of our cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result in a material impairment, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
 
We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.
 
Our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items. We are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.
 
Our operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations.
 
Our operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. Our quarterly, year-to-date, and annual expenses as a percentage of our revenues may differ significantly from our historical or projected rates. Our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations. Any of these events could cause our stock price to fall. Each of the risk factors listed in this section in addition to the following factors may affect our operating results:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Because our business is changing and evolving, our historical operating results may not be useful to you in predicting our future operating results. In addition, advertising spending has historically been cyclical in nature, reflecting overall economic conditions, as well as budgeting and buying patterns. Also, user traffic tends to be seasonal. Our rapid growth has tended to mask the cyclicality and seasonality of our business. As our growth rate has slowed, the cyclicality and seasonality in our business has become more pronounced and caused our operating results to fluctuate.
 
Motorola could be subject to significant liability under a Tax Sharing Agreement with Motorola Solutions if the Merger or subsequent transactions were to cause the spinoff of Motorola from Motorola Solutions (the Spinoff) to fail to qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 
In connection with the Spinoff, Motorola and Motorola Solutions entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement (the Tax Sharing Agreement) under which Motorola agreed not to take any of certain actions during the two-year period ending January 4, 2013, without the receipt of a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service or an opinion of tax counsel, in either case acceptable to Motorola Solutions in its discretion, to the effect that such action will not affect the tax-free status of the Spinoff and certain related transactions (or the waiver by Motorola Solutions of the requirement to obtain the private letter ruling or opinion of tax counsel). Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz issued an opinion to Motorola and to Motorola Solutions, dated August 14, 2011, to the effect that, based on representations made by Motorola and Motorola Solutions and subject to the limitations and qualifications set out in the opinion, the acquisition of Motorola will not affect the tax-free status of the Spinoff and certain related transactions.  Motorola Solutions accepted that opinion as satisfying the requirements of the Tax Sharing Agreement with respect to the acquisition.
 
 
 
 
Notwithstanding acceptance of the opinion by Motorola Solutions, under the Tax Sharing Agreement, which remains in effect, Motorola must indemnify Motorola Solutions and its affiliates against any and all tax-related liabilities incurred by them relating to the Spinoff and certain related transactions to the extent caused by Motorola.  This obligation is not capped and could subject Motorola to substantial liabilities.  Moreover, restrictions under the Tax Sharing Agreement may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions with respect to Motorolas stock or assets, or to engage in new business or other transactions intended to maximize the value of Motorolas business.
 
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Stock
 
.
The trading price for our Class A common stock may continue to be volatile, and if the creation of our proposed class of non-voting Class C capital stock is approved by stockholders and shares of the new class are distributed as expected, the trading price of that class may also be volatile and may affect the trading price for the Class A common stock
 
The trading price of our Class A common stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility and may continue to be volatile. For example, from January 3, 2011 through March 31, 2012, the closing price of our Class A common stock ranged from $474.88 per share to $668.28 per share. The trading price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, we recently announced a proposal to create a new class of non-voting capital stock, known as the Class C capital stock, to help us manage the dilutive impact of additional equity issuances in financing and stock-based acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs. Although the proposal is subject to stockholder approval at our 2012 annual meeting of stockholders, Larry and Sergey will have the power, based on the size of their beneficial ownership of our Class A and Class B common stock, to approve the proposal without the affirmative vote of any other stockholder. They and Eric have also indicated their intention to vote in favor of the proposal. We also announced the intention of our board of directors, if the proposal is approved, to consider a distribution of shares of the Class C capital stock as a dividend to our holders of Class A and Class B common stock.
 
Although we plan to list the Class C capital stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market, we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, a liquid trading market will develop for the Class C capital stock. If it does not or if the Class C capital stock is not attractive to targets as an acquisition currency or to our employees as an incentive, we may not achieve our objectives in creating this new class. As in the case of the Class A common stock, the trading price for the Class C capital stock may also be volatile and affected by the factors noted above, as well as by the difference in voting rights as between the Class A common stock and the Class C capital stock, the volume of Class C capital stock available for public sale and sales by us and our stockholders of Class C capital stock, including by institutional investors that may be unwilling, unable or choose not to hold non-voting shares they receive as part of the stock dividend, if it is declared and paid. Whether or not the Class C capital stock is included in stock indices in the future may also affect the trading prices of the Class A common stock and the Class C capital stock.
 
 
 
 
In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our Class A common stock, and, if approved and issued, our Class C capital Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.
 
The concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders ability to influence corporate matters.
 
Our Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of March 31, 2012, Larry, Sergey, and Eric beneficially owned approximately 92% of our outstanding Class B common stock, representing approximately 66% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Larry, Sergey, and Eric therefore have significant influence over management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, as noted above, we have announced a proposal to create the Class C capital stock and the intention of our board of directors to consider a stock dividend of shares of this new class. Because the Class C capital stock carries no voting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C capital stock, including in future stock-based acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could prolong the duration of Larry and Sergeys current relative ownership of our voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. Together with Eric, they would also continue to be able to control any required stockholder vote with respect to certain change in control transactions involving Google (including an acquisition of Google by another company).
 
This concentrated control limits or severely restricts our stockholders ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneficial. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock and, if approved and issued, our Class C capital stock could be adversely affected.
 
Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.
 
Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.

Google's 2012 Stock Plan and 2012 Incentive Compensation Plan for Employees and Consultants of Motorola Mobility
On June 21, 2012, at the 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Google Inc. ("Google"), Google's stockholders approved the Google Inc. 2012 Stock Plan and the Google Inc. 2012 Incentive Compensation Plan for Employees and Consultants of Motorola Mobility. A description of these plans is set forth in Google's definitive proxy statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on May 9, 2012 and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of these plans, copies of which are filed as Exhibits 10.01 and 10.02 to this Form 8-K.
 
The following proposals were submitted to Google's stockholders at the 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on June 21, 2012:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For more information about the foregoing proposals, see Google's definitive proxy statement dated May 9, 2012.
Holders of the shares of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of the shares of Class B common stock are entitled to 10 votes per share. Holders of the shares of Class A common stock and holders of the shares of Class B common stock voted together as a single class on all matters (including the election of directors) submitted to a vote of stockholders at this annual meeting. In addition, holders of the shares of Class B common stock voted as a separate class on the proposal to approve the adoption of Google's Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (comprising three proposals).
The number of votes cast for and against and the number of abstentions and broker non-votes with respect to each matter voted upon are set forth below:
 
The 10 nominees were elected to Google's Board of Directors and will serve as directors until Google's next annual meeting or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified.
 
The results of the voting were 861,377,964 votes for, 1,507,794 votes against, and 651,575 abstentions. There were no broker non-votes on this matter. The appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as Google's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2012 was ratified.
 
 
 
 
The results of the voting on Proposal Numbers 3A, 3B, and 3C, with (1) holders of the shares of Class A common stock and holders of the shares of Class B common stock voting together as a single class, and (2) holders of the shares of Class B common stock voting as a separate class, are set forth below:
 
Each of the proposals comprising Proposal Number 3 had been cross-conditioned upon the approval by Google's stockholders of all of the proposals comprising Proposal Number 3. The approval of each of the proposals comprising Proposal Number 3 constituted the requisite approval of the adoption of the Google's Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation as required by Delaware law. The adoption of Google's Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation was approved.
 
The results of the voting were 673,835,311 votes for, 160,535,207 votes against, 692,672 abstentions, and 28,474,143 broker non-votes. Google's 2012 Stock Plan was approved.
 
The results of the voting were 676,204,541 votes for, 158,174,848 votes against, 683,876 abstentions, and 28,474,068 broker non-votes. Google's 2012 Incentive Compensation Plan for Employees and Consultants of Motorola Mobility was approved.
 
The results of the voting were 6,995,169 votes for, 807,879,913 votes against, 20,187,757 abstentions, and 28,474,494 broker non-votes. The stockholder proposal regarding an advisory vote on political contributions was defeated.
 
The results of the voting were 2,980,698 votes for, 830,806,516 votes against, 1,275,669 abstentions, and 28,474,459 broker non-votes. The stockholder proposal regarding mandatory arbitration of certain shareholder claims was defeated.
 
The results of the voting were 147,240,478 votes for, 686,884,401 votes against, 938,344 abstentions, and 28,474,110 broker non-votes. The stockholder proposal regarding equal shareholder voting was defeated.
On June 22, 2012, Google filed the Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. As previously reported, Google's recapitalization is the subject of pending litigation. Once this litigation has been resolved, Google expects its Board of Directors to consider the declaration of a dividend of one share of Class C capital stock for each share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock outstanding as of a record date to be determined at that time by the Board of Directors. Google cannot predict when the pending litigation will be resolved, but does not expect it to occur before the fourth quarter of 2012.
 
On June 26, 2012, Google issued a press release announcing that it had posted a short presentation (the "Presentation") focusing on the general framework of Google's financial disclosure to incorporate the results of former Motorola Mobility Holdings, Inc. Copies of the press release and the Presentation are filed as Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2, respectively, to this Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 10.01
1.
Purpose of the Plan
This Plan is intended to promote the interests of the Company and its stockholders by providing the employees and consultants of the Company and members of the Board of Directors with incentives and rewards to encourage them to continue in the service of the Company and with a proprietary interest in pursuing the long-term growth, profitability and financial success of the Company.
2.
Definitions
As used in the Plan or in any instrument governing the terms of any Incentive Award, the following definitions apply to the terms indicated below:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.
Stock Subject to the Plan and Limitations on Cash Incentive Awards
(a)
Stock Subject to the Plan
The maximum number of shares of Capital Stock that may be covered by Incentive Awards granted under the Plan shall not exceed 30,000,000 shares of Capital Stock in the aggregate. The maximum number of shares of Capital Stock that may be covered by Incentive Awards granted under the Plan that are intended to be ISOs shall not exceed 30,000,000 shares of Capital Stock in the aggregate. The shares referred to in the preceding sentences of this paragraph shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 10 and the following provisions of this Section 3. Shares of Capital Stock issued under the Plan may be either authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares, or both, at the sole discretion of the Committee.
 
For purposes of the preceding paragraph, shares of Capital Stock covered by Incentive Awards shall only be counted as used to the extent they are actually issued and delivered to a Participant (or such Participant's permitted transferees as described in the Plan) pursuant to the Plan. For purposes of clarification, in accordance with the preceding sentence if an Incentive Award is settled for cash or if shares of Capital Stock are withheld to pay the exercise price of an Option or to satisfy any tax withholding requirement in connection with an Incentive Award, only the shares issued (if any), net of the shares withheld, will be deemed delivered for purposes of determining the number of shares of Capital Stock that are available for delivery under the Plan. In addition, shares of Capital Stock related to Incentive Awards that expire, are forfeited or cancelled or terminate for any reason without the issuance of shares shall not be treated as issued pursuant to the Plan. In addition, if shares of Capital Stock owned by a Participant (or such Participant's permitted transferees as described in the Plan) are tendered (either actually or through attestation) to the Company in payment of any obligation in connection with an Incentive Award, the number of shares tendered shall be added to the number of shares of Capital Stock that are available for delivery under the Plan. Shares of Capital Stock covered by Incentive Awards granted pursuant to the Plan in connection with the conversion, replacement, or adjustment of outstanding equity-based awards to reflect a merger or acquisition (within the meaning of NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(c) and Interpretive Material 5635-1) shall not count as used under the Plan for purposes of this Section 3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, shares of Capital Stock attributable to Incentive Awards transferred under any Incentive Award Transfer Program shall not again be available for delivery under the Plan.
(b)
Individual Award Limits
Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 10, the maximum number of shares of Capital Stock that may be covered by Incentive Awards intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation that are granted to any Covered Employee in any calendar year shall not exceed 1,000,000 shares. The amount payable to any Covered Employee with respect to any calendar year for all Cash Incentive Awards shall not exceed $100 million. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the phrase "amount payable with respect to any calendar year" means the amount of cash, or value of other property, required to be paid based on the achievement of applicable Performance Measures during a Performance Period that ends in a calendar year, disregarding any deferral pursuant to the terms of a Deferred Compensation Plan unless the terms of the deferral are intended to comply with the requirements for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code.
4.
Administration of the Plan
The Plan shall be administered by a Committee of the Board of Directors consisting of two or more persons, each of whom qualifies as a "non-employee director" (within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under Section 16 of the Exchange Act), an "outside director" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.162-27(e)(3) and as "independent" within the meaning of any applicable stock exchange listing rules or similar regulatory authority. The Committee shall, consistent with the terms of the Plan, from time to time designate those employees and consultants of the Company and members of the Board of Directors who shall be granted Incentive Awards under the Plan and the amount, type and other terms and conditions of such Incentive Awards. All of the powers and responsibilities of the Committee under the Plan may be delegated by the Committee to any subcommittee thereof. In addition, the Committee may from time to time authorize a subcommittee consisting of one or more members of the Board of Directors (including members who are employees of the Company) or employees of the Company to grant Incentive Awards, subject to such restrictions and limitation as the Committee may specify and to the requirements of Delaware General Corporation Law Section 157.
The Committee shall have full discretionary authority to administer the Plan, including discretionary authority to interpret and construe any and all provisions of the Plan and the terms of any Incentive Award (and any agreement evidencing the grant of any Incentive Award) granted thereunder and to adopt and amend from time to time such rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan as the Committee may deem necessary or appropriate. The Committee shall have the authority, in its discretion, to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, including rules and regulations related to sub-plans established for the purpose of satisfying applicable foreign laws and/or qualifying for preferred tax treatment under applicable foreign tax laws. For purposes of clarity, the Committee may exercise all discretion granted to it under the Plan in a non-uniform manner among Participants.
 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, the Committee shall determine whether an authorized leave of absence, or absence in military or government service, shall constitute termination of employment, provided that a Participant who is an employee will not be deemed to cease employment in the case of any leave of absence approved by the Company. Unless the Committee provides otherwise in the agreement evidencing the grant of an Incentive Award, vesting of Incentive Awards granted hereunder will be suspended during any unpaid leave of absence and will resume on the date the Participant returns to work on a regular schedule as determined by the Company, it being understood that no vesting credit will be awarded for the time vesting has been suspended during such leave of absence. For purposes of ISOs, no such leave may exceed ninety (90) days, unless reemployment upon expiration of such leave is guaranteed by statute or contract. If reemployment upon expiration of a leave of absence approved by the Company is not so guaranteed, then three months following the 91
st
day of such leave any ISO held by the Participant will cease to be treated as an ISO and will be treated for tax purposes as a non-qualified Option. The provisions of this paragraph shall be administered and interpreted in a manner that does not give rise to any tax under Section 409A of the Code.
The employment of a Participant with the Company shall be deemed to have terminated for all purposes of the Plan if such Participant is employed by or provides services to a Person that is a Subsidiary of the Company and such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Company, unless the Committee determines otherwise. The Committee may, without limitation and in its discretion, in connection with any such determination, provide for the accelerated vesting of any Incentive Award upon or after such cessation, subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee shall specify. The employment of a Participant with the Company shall not be deemed to have terminated for any purpose of the Plan if such Participant is employed by a Person that is part of the Company, and such Participant's employment is subsequently transferred to any other Person that is part of the Company, unless and to the extent the Committee specifies otherwise in writing in the instrument evidencing the grant of an Incentive Award or otherwise. A Participant who ceases to be an employee of the Company but continues, or simultaneously commences, services as a consultant or director of the Company shall not be deemed to have had a termination of employment for purposes of the Plan, unless the Committee determines otherwise. Decisions of the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive on all parties. All discretion granted to the Committee pursuant to this paragraph must be exercised in a manner that would not cause any tax to become due under Section 409A of the Code.
On or after the date of grant of an Incentive Award under the Plan, the Committee may (i) accelerate the date on which any such Incentive Award becomes vested, exercisable or transferable, as the case may be, (ii) extend the term of any such Incentive Award, including, without limitation, extending the period following a termination of a Participant's employment during which any such Incentive Award may remain outstanding, (iii) waive any conditions to the vesting, exercisability or transferability, as the case may be, of any such Incentive Award, or (iv) provide for the payment of dividends or dividend equivalents with respect to any such Incentive Award; , that the Committee shall not have any such authority to the extent that the grant of such authority would cause any tax to become due under Section 409A of the Code.
provided
The Board of Directors or the Committee may, at any time, in its sole and complete discretion, implement an Incentive Award Transfer Program.
The Company shall pay any amount payable with respect to an Incentive Award in accordance with the terms of such Incentive Award, provided that the Committee may, in its discretion, defer the payment of amounts payable with respect to an Incentive Award subject to and in accordance with the terms of a Deferred Compensation Plan.
 
5.
Eligibility
The Persons who shall be eligible to be selected by the Committee from time to time to receive Incentive Awards pursuant to the Plan shall be those Persons (a) who are employees and consultants of, or who render services directly or indirectly to, the Company or (b) who are members of the Board of Directors. Each Incentive Award granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by an instrument in writing in form and substance approved by the Committee.
6.
Options
The Committee may from time to time grant Options, subject to the following terms and conditions:
(a)
Exercise Price
The exercise price per share of Capital Stock covered by any Option shall be not less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Capital Stock on the date on which such Option is granted.
(b)
Term and Exercise of Options
(i) Each Option shall become vested and exercisable on such date or dates, during such period and for such number of shares of Capital Stock as shall be determined by the Committee on or after the date such Option is granted and set forth in the agreement evidencing the grant of such Option; , that no Option shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date such Option is granted; and, , , that each Option shall be subject to earlier termination, expiration or cancellation as provided in the Plan or in the agreement evidencing the grant of such Option.
provided
however
provided
further
(ii) Each Option may be exercised in whole or in part; , that no partial exercise of an Option shall be for an aggregate exercise price of less than $1,000. The partial exercise of an Option shall not cause the expiration, termination or cancellation of the remaining portion thereof.
provided
however
(iii) An Option shall be exercised by such methods and procedures as the Committee determines from time to time, including without limitation through net physical settlement or other method of cashless exercise.
(iv) Options may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of a Participant, only by the Participant; , that the Committee may permit in its discretion Options to be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of, on a general or specific basis, subject to such conditions and limitations as the Committee may determine, including through the implementation of an Incentive Award Transfer Program.
provided
however
(c)
Effect of Termination of Employment or Other Relationship
The agreement evidencing the grant of each Option shall specify the consequences with respect to such Option of the termination of the employment or other service between the Company and the Participant holding the Option.
(d)
Additional Terms for ISOs
Each Option that is intended to qualify as an ISO shall be designated as such in the agreement evidencing its grant, and each agreement evidencing the grant of an Option that does not include any such designation shall be deemed to be a non-qualified Option. ISOs may only be granted to Persons who are employees of the Company. The aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the date of grant of the ISOs) of the number of shares of Capital Stock with respect to which ISOs are exercisable for the first time by any Participant during any calendar year under all plans of the Company shall not exceed $100,000, or such other maximum amount as is then applicable under Section 422 of the Code. Any Option or a portion thereof that is designated as an ISO that for any reason fails to meet the requirements of an ISO shall be treated hereunder as a non-qualified Option. No ISO may be granted to a Person who, at the time of the proposed grant, owns (or is deemed to own under the Code) stock possessing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of common stock of the Company unless (i) the exercise price of such ISO is at least one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value of a share of Capital Stock at the time such ISO is granted and (ii) such ISO is not exercisable after the expiration of five years from the date it is granted.
 
(e) .
Repricing
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Google may reprice any Option without the approval of the stockholders of Google. For this purpose, "reprice" means (i) any of the following or any other action that has the same effect: (A) lowering the exercise price of an Option after it is granted, (B) any other action that is treated as a repricing under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""), or (C) cancelling an Option at a time when its exercise price exceeds the Fair Market Value of the underlying Capital Stock, in exchange for another Option, restricted stock or other equity, unless the cancellation and exchange occurs in connection with a merger, acquisition, spin-off or other similar corporate transaction; and (ii) any other action that is considered to be a repricing under formal or informal guidance issued by The NASDAQ Stock Market.
GAAP
7.
Other Stock-Based Awards
The Committee may grant equity-based or equity-related awards not otherwise described herein in such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, each such Other Stock-Based Award may (a) involve the transfer of actual shares of Capital Stock to Participants, either at the time of grant or thereafter, or payment in cash or otherwise of amounts based on the value of shares of Capital Stock, (b) be subject to performance-based and/or service-based conditions, (c) be in the form of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, deferred share units or share-denominated performance units, (d) be designed to comply with applicable laws of jurisdictions other than the United States and (e) be designed to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation; , that each Other Stock-Based Award shall be denominated in, or shall have a value determined by reference to, a number of shares of Capital Stock that is specified at the time of the grant of such award.
provided
8.
Cash Incentive Awards
The Committee may grant Cash Incentive Awards with respect to any Performance Period, subject to terms and conditions determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, provided that such terms and conditions are consistent with the terms and conditions of the Plan. Cash Incentive Awards may be settled in cash or in other property, including shares of Capital Stock, provided that the term "Cash Incentive Award" shall exclude any Stock Incentive Award. Cash Incentive Awards shall be designed to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation.
9.
Performance-Based Compensation
(a)
Calculation
The amount payable with respect to an Incentive Award that is intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation shall be determined in any manner permitted by Section 162(m) of the Code.
(b)
Discretionary Reduction
Unless otherwise specified in the agreement evidencing the grant of an Incentive Award that is intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation, the Committee may, in its discretion, reduce or eliminate the amount payable to any Participant with respect to the Incentive Award, based on such factors as the Committee may deem relevant, but the Committee may not increase any such amount above the amount established in accordance with the relevant Performance Schedule. For purposes of clarity, the Committee may exercise the discretion provided by the foregoing sentence in a non-uniform manner among Participants.
 
(c)
Performance Measures

A Performance Measure (i) may relate to the performance of the Participant, Google, a Subsidiary of Google, the Company, any business group, business unit or other subdivision of the Company, or any combination of the foregoing, as the Committee deems appropriate and (ii) may be expressed as an amount, as an increase or decrease over a specified period, as a relative comparison to the performance of a group of comparator companies or a published or special index, or any other external measure of the selected performance criteria, as the Committee deems appropriate. The measurement of any Performance Measure may exclude the impact of unusual, non-recurring or extraordinary items or expenses; items relating to financing activities; charges for restructurings or productivity initiatives; other non-operating items; discontinued operations; items related to the disposal of a business or segment of a business; the cumulative effect of changes in accounting treatment; items related to a change in accounting principle; items related to changes in applicable laws or business conditions; any impact of impairment of tangible or intangible assets; any impact of the issuance or repurchase of equity securities and or other changes in the number of outstanding shares of any class of Google equity securities; any gain, loss, income or expense attributable to acquisitions or dispositions of stock or assets; items attributable to the business operations of any entity acquired by Google during a Performance Period; stock-based compensation expense; in-process research and development expense; future contributions to the Google Foundation; gain or loss from all or certain claims and/or litigation and insurance recoveries; items that are outside the scope of Google's core, on-going business activities; and any other items, each determined in accordance with GAAP and as identified in Google's audited financial statements, including the notes thereto.
(d)
Performance Schedules
Within ninety (90) days after the beginning of a Performance Period, and in any case before twenty-five percent (25%) of the Performance Period has elapsed, the Committee shall establish (a) Performance Targets for such Performance Period, (b) Target Awards for each Participant, and (c) Performance Schedules for such Performance Period.
(e)
Termination of Employment
With respect to an Incentive Award that is intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation, the consequences of the termination of employment of the Participant holding such Incentive Award shall be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion and set forth in the applicable agreement evidencing the grant of the Incentive Award, it being intended that no agreement providing for a payment to a Participant upon termination of employment shall be given effect to the extent that it would cause an Incentive Award that was intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation to fail to so qualify.
 
(f)
Committee Discretion
Nothing in this Section 9 is intended to limit the Committee's discretion to adopt conditions with respect to any Incentive Award that is not intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation. In addition, the Committee may, subject to the terms of the Plan, amend previously granted Incentive Awards in a way that disqualifies them as Performance-Based Compensation.
10.
Adjustment Upon Certain Changes
Subject to any action by the stockholders of Google required by law, applicable tax rules or the rules of any exchange on which shares of common stock of Google (for the avoidance of doubt, references to common stock of Google in this Plan shall include Capital Stock) are listed for trading:
(a)
Shares Available for Grants
In the event of any change in the number or type of shares of common stock of Google outstanding by reason of any stock dividend or split, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, combination or exchange of shares or similar corporate change, or any change in the type and number of shares of common stock of Google outstanding by reason of any other event or transaction, the Committee shall make appropriate adjustments in the type and maximum aggregate number of shares with respect to which the Committee may grant Incentive Awards, the type and maximum aggregate number of shares with respect to which the Committee may grant Incentive Awards that are intended to be ISOs, and the type and maximum aggregate number of shares with respect to which the Committee may grant Incentive Awards that are intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation to any Covered Employee in any calendar year.
(b)
Increase or Decrease in Issued Shares Without Consideration
In the event of any increase or decrease in the number or type of issued shares of common stock of Google resulting from a subdivision or consolidation of shares of common stock of Google or the payment of a stock dividend (but only on the shares of common stock of Google), or any other increase or decrease in the number of such shares effected without receipt or payment of consideration by the Company, the Committee shall appropriately adjust the type or number of shares subject to each outstanding Incentive Award and the exercise price per share, if any, of shares subject to each such Incentive Award.
(c)
Certain Mergers
In the event of any merger, consolidation or similar transaction as a result of which the holders of shares of Capital Stock receive consideration consisting exclusively of securities of the surviving corporation in such transaction, the Committee shall appropriately adjust each Incentive Award outstanding on the date of such merger or consolidation so that it pertains and applies to the securities which a holder of the number of shares of Capital Stock subject to such Incentive Award would have received in such merger or consolidation.
(d)
Certain Other Transactions
In the event of (i) a dissolution or liquidation of Google, (ii) a sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets (on a consolidated basis) or (iii) a merger, consolidation or similar transaction involving Google in which the holders of shares of Capital Stock receive securities and/or other property, including cash, other than shares of the surviving corporation in such transaction, the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, have the power to:
(A) cancel, effective immediately prior to the occurrence of such event, each Incentive Award (whether or not then exercisable or vested), and, in full consideration of such cancellation, pay to the Participant to whom such Incentive Award was granted an amount in cash, for each share of Capital Stock subject to such Incentive Award, equal to the value, as determined by the Committee, of such share of Capital Stock, provided that with respect to the shares of Capital Stock subject to any outstanding Option such value shall be equal to the excess of (1) the value, as determined by the Committee, of the property (including cash) received by the holder of a share of Capital Stock as a result of such event over (2) the exercise price of a share of Capital Stock subject to such Option; or
 
(B) provide for the exchange of each Incentive Award (whether or not then exercisable or vested) for an Incentive Award with respect to (1) some or all of the property which a holder of the number of shares of Capital Stock subject to such Incentive Award would have received in such transaction or (2) securities of the acquirer or surviving corporation, and, incident thereto, make an equitable adjustment as determined by the Committee in the exercise price per share, if any, of stock subject to the Incentive Award, or the number of shares or amount of property subject to the Incentive Award or provide for a payment (in cash or other property) to the Participant to whom such Incentive Award was granted in partial consideration for the exchange of the Incentive Award.
(e)
Other Changes
In the event of any change in the capitalization of Google or corporate change other than those specifically referred to in paragraphs 10(b), (c) or (d), including without limitation, any extraordinary cash dividend, spin-off, split-off, sale of a Subsidiary or business unit, or similar transaction, the Committee may make such adjustments in the issuer, number and class of shares subject to Stock Incentive Awards outstanding on the date on which such change occurs, such as, for example, a rollover of Stock Incentive Awards, and in such other terms of such Incentive Award, including without limitation in any Performance Schedule, Performance Target or Target Award, as the Committee may consider appropriate, provided that if any such Incentive Award is intended to be Performance-Based Compensation such adjustment is consistent with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code.
(f)
Cash Incentive Awards
In the event of any transaction or event described in this Section 10, including without limitation any corporate change referred to in paragraph (e) hereof, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, make such adjustments in any Performance Schedule, Performance Target or Target Award, and in such other terms of any Cash Incentive Award, as the Committee may consider appropriate in respect of such transaction or event, provided that such adjustments must be consistent with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code.
(g)
No Other Rights
Except as expressly provided in the Plan, no Participant shall have any rights by reason of any subdivision or consolidation of shares of stock of any class, the payment of any dividend, any increase or decrease in the number of shares of stock of any class or any dissolution, liquidation, merger or consolidation of Google or any other corporation. Except as expressly provided in the Plan, no issuance by Google of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number of shares or amount of other property subject to, or the terms related to, any Incentive Award.
(h)
Savings Clause
No provision of this Section 10 shall be given effect to the extent that such provision would cause any tax to become due under Section 409A of the Code.
11.
Rights Under the Plan
No Person shall have any rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares of Capital Stock covered by or relating to any Incentive Award until the date of the issuance of such shares on the books and records of Google. Except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 10 hereof, no adjustment of any Incentive Award shall be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date occurs prior to the date of such issuance. Nothing in this Section 11 is intended, or should be construed, to limit the authority of the Committee to cause the Company to make payments based on the dividends that would be payable with respect to any share of Capital Stock if it were issued or outstanding, or from granting rights related to such dividends.
 
The Company shall not have any obligation to establish any separate fund or trust or other segregation of assets to provide for payments under the Plan. To the extent any person acquires any rights to receive payments hereunder from the Company, such rights shall be no greater than those of an unsecured creditor.
12.
No Special Employment Rights; No Right to Incentive Award
(a) Nothing contained in the Plan or any agreement evidence the grant of any Incentive Award shall confer upon any Participant any right with respect to the continuation of his employment by or service to the Company or interfere in any way with the right of the Company at any time to terminate such employment or service or to increase or decrease the compensation of the Participant from the rate in existence at the time of the grant of an Incentive Award.
(b) No person shall have any claim or right to receive an Incentive Award hereunder. The Committee's granting of an Incentive Award to a Participant at any time shall neither require the Committee to grant an Incentive Award to such Participant or any other Participant or other person at any time nor preclude the Committee from making subsequent grants to such Participant or any other Participant or other person.
13.
Securities Matters
(a) Google shall be under no obligation to effect the registration pursuant to the Securities Act of any shares of Capital Stock to be issued hereunder or to effect similar compliance under any state or local laws. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Google shall not be obligated to cause to be issued any shares of Capital Stock pursuant to the Plan unless and until Google is advised by its counsel that the issuance of such shares is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations of governmental authority and the requirements of any securities exchange on which shares of Capital Stock are traded. The Committee may require, as a condition to the issuance of shares of Capital Stock pursuant to the terms hereof, that the recipient of such shares make such covenants, agreements and representations, and that any certificates representing such shares bear such legends, as the Committee deems necessary or desirable.
(b) The exercise of any Option granted hereunder shall only be effective at such time as counsel to Google shall have determined that the issuance of shares of Capital Stock pursuant to such exercise is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations of governmental authority and the requirements of any securities exchange on which shares of Capital Stock are traded. Google may, in its sole discretion, defer the effectiveness of an exercise of an Option hereunder or the issuance of shares of Capital Stock pursuant to any Incentive Award pending or to ensure compliance under federal, state or local securities laws. Google shall inform the Participant in writing of its decision to defer the effectiveness of the exercise of an Option or the issuance of shares of Capital Stock pursuant to any Incentive Award. During the period that the effectiveness of the exercise of an Option has been deferred, the Participant may, by written notice, withdraw such exercise and obtain the refund of any amount paid with respect thereto.
14.
Withholding Taxes
(a)
Cash Remittance
Whenever shares of Capital Stock are to be issued upon the exercise of an Option or the grant or vesting of an Incentive Award, and whenever any amount shall become payable in respect of any Incentive Award, Google shall have the right to require the Participant to remit to Google in cash an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state and local withholding tax requirements, if any, attributable to such exercise, grant, vesting or payment prior to issuance of such shares or the effectiveness of the lapse of such restrictions or making of such payment. In addition, upon the exercise or settlement of any Incentive Award in cash, or the making of any other payment with respect to any Incentive Award (other than in shares of Capital Stock), Google shall have the right to withhold from any payment required to be made pursuant thereto an amount sufficient to satisfy the federal, state and local withholding tax requirements, if any, attributable to such exercise, settlement or payment.
 
(b)
Stock Remittance
At the election of the Participant, subject to the approval of the Committee, when shares of Capital Stock are to be issued upon the exercise, grant or vesting of an Incentive Award, the Participant may tender to Google a number of shares of Capital Stock that have been owned by the Participant for at least six months (or such other period as the Committee may determine) having a Fair Market Value at the tender date determined by the Committee to be sufficient to satisfy the minimum federal, state and local withholding tax requirements, if any, attributable to such exercise, grant or vesting but not greater than the minimum withholding obligations, as determined by Google in its sole discretion. Such election shall satisfy the Participant's obligations under Section 14(a) hereof, if any.
(c)
Stock Withholding
When shares of Capital Stock are to be issued upon the exercise, grant or vesting of an Incentive Award, Google shall have the authority to withhold a number of such shares having a Fair Market Value at the date of the applicable taxable event determined by the Committee to be sufficient to satisfy the minimum federal, state and local withholding tax requirements, if any, attributable to such exercise, grant or vesting but not greater than the minimum withholding obligations, as determined by Google in its sole discretion.
15.
Amendment or Termination of the Plan
The Board of Directors may at any time suspend or discontinue the Plan or revise or amend it in any respect whatsoever; , , that to the extent that any applicable law, tax requirement, or rule of a stock exchange requires stockholder approval in order for any such revision or amendment to be effective, such revision or amendment shall not be effective without such approval. The preceding sentence shall not restrict the Committee's ability to exercise its discretionary authority hereunder pursuant to Section 4 hereof, which discretion may be exercised without amendment to the Plan. No provision of this Section 15 shall be given effect to the extent that such provision would cause any tax to become due under Section 409A of the Code. Except as expressly provided in the Plan, no action hereunder may, without the consent of a Participant, reduce the Participant's rights under any previously granted and outstanding Incentive Award. Nothing in the Plan shall limit the right of the Company to pay compensation of any kind outside the terms of the Plan.
provided
however
16.
No Obligation to Exercise
The grant to a Participant of an Incentive Award shall impose no obligation upon such Participant to exercise such Incentive Award.
17.
Transfers Upon Death
Upon the death of a Participant, outstanding Incentive Awards granted to such Participant may be exercised by the Participant's designated beneficiary, provided that such beneficiary has been designated prior to the Participant's death. Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the Participant and shall be effective only if given in a form and manner acceptable to the Committee. In the absence of any such effective designation, such Incentive Awards may be exercised only by the executors or administrators of the Participant's estate or by any person or persons who shall have acquired such right to exercise by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. No transfer by will or the laws of descent and distribution of any Incentive Award, or the right to exercise any Incentive Award, shall be effective to bind Google unless the Committee shall have been furnished with (a) written notice thereof and with a copy of the will and/or such evidence as the Committee may deem necessary to establish the validity of the transfer and (b) an agreement by the transferee to comply with all the terms and conditions of the Incentive Award that are or would have been applicable to the Participant and to be bound by the acknowledgements made by the Participant in connection with the grant of the Incentive Award.
18.
Expenses and Receipts
The expenses of the Plan shall be paid by the Company. Any proceeds received by Google in connection with any Incentive Award will be used for general corporate purposes.
 
19.
Governing Law
The Plan and the rights of all persons under the Plan shall be construed and administered in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of law principles.
20.
Effective Date and Term of Plan
The Plan was approved by the Board of Directors on April 11, 2012, subject to the approval of the Plan by the stockholders of Google. No grants of Incentive Awards may be made under the Plan after April 11, 2022.
 

Exhibit 10.02
1.
Purpose of the Plan

2.
Definitions
As used in the Plan or in any instrument governing the terms of any Incentive Award, the following definitions apply to the terms indicated below:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.
Stock Subject to the Plan and Limitations on Cash Incentive Awards
(a)
Stock Subject to the Plan
The maximum number of shares of Capital Stock that may be covered by Incentive Awards granted under the Plan shall not exceed 2,000,000 shares of Capital Stock in the aggregate. The maximum number of shares of Capital Stock that may be covered by Incentive Awards granted under the Plan that are intended to be ISOs shall not exceed 2,000,000 shares of Capital Stock in the aggregate. The shares referred to in the preceding sentences of this paragraph shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 10 and the following provisions of this Section 3. Shares of Capital Stock issued under the Plan may be either authorized and unissued shares or treasury shares, or both, at the sole discretion of the Committee.
 
For purposes of the preceding paragraph, shares of Capital Stock covered by Incentive Awards shall only be counted as used to the extent they are actually issued and delivered to a Participant (or such Participant's permitted transferees as described in the Plan) pursuant to the Plan. For purposes of clarification, in accordance with the preceding sentence if an Incentive Award is settled for cash or if shares of Capital Stock are withheld to pay the exercise price of an Option or to satisfy any tax withholding requirement in connection with an Incentive Award, only the shares issued (if any), net of the shares withheld, will be deemed delivered for purposes of determining the number of shares of Capital Stock that are available for delivery under the Plan. In addition, shares of Capital Stock related to Incentive Awards that expire, are forfeited or cancelled or terminate for any reason without the issuance of shares shall not be treated as issued pursuant to the Plan. In addition, if shares of Capital Stock owned by a Participant (or such Participant's permitted transferees as described in the Plan) are tendered (either actually or through attestation) to the Company in payment of any obligation in connection with an Incentive Award, the number of shares tendered shall be added to the number of shares of Capital Stock that are available for delivery under the Plan. Shares of Capital Stock covered by Incentive Awards granted pursuant to the Plan in connection with the conversion, replacement, or adjustment of outstanding equity-based awards to reflect a merger or acquisition (within the meaning of NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(c) and Interpretive Material 5635-1) shall not count as used under the Plan for purposes of this Section 3.
(b)
Individual Award Limits
Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 10, the maximum number of shares of Capital Stock that may be covered by Incentive Awards intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation that are granted to any Covered Employee in any calendar year shall not exceed 1,000,000 shares. The amount payable to any Covered Employee with respect to any calendar year for all Cash Incentive Awards shall not exceed $100 million. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the phrase "amount payable with respect to any calendar year" means the amount of cash, or value of other property, required to be paid based on the achievement of applicable Performance Measures during a Performance Period that ends in a calendar year, disregarding any deferral pursuant to the terms of a Deferred Compensation Plan unless the terms of the deferral are intended to comply with the requirements for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code.
4.
Administration of the Plan
The Plan shall be administered by a Committee of the Board of Directors consisting of two or more persons, each of whom qualifies as a "non-employee director" (within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under Section 16 of the Exchange Act), an "outside director" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.162-27(e)(3) and as "independent" within the meaning of any applicable stock exchange listing rules or similar regulatory authority. The Committee shall, consistent with the terms of the Plan, from time to time designate those employees and consultants of MMI who shall be granted Incentive Awards under the Plan and the amount, type and other terms and conditions of such Incentive Awards. All of the powers and responsibilities of the Committee under the Plan may be delegated by the Committee to any subcommittee thereof. In addition, the Committee may from time to time authorize a subcommittee consisting of one or more members of the Board of Directors (including members who are employees of the Company) or employees of the Company to grant Incentive Awards, subject to such restrictions and limitation as the Committee may specify and to the requirements of Delaware General Corporation Law Section 157.
The Committee shall have full discretionary authority to administer the Plan, including discretionary authority to interpret and construe any and all provisions of the Plan and the terms of any Incentive Award (and any agreement evidencing the grant of any Incentive Award) granted thereunder and to adopt and amend from time to time such rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan as the Committee may deem necessary or appropriate. The Committee shall have the authority, in its discretion, to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, including rules and regulations related to sub-plans established for the purpose of satisfying applicable foreign laws and/or qualifying for preferred tax treatment under applicable foreign tax laws. For purposes of clarity, the Committee may exercise all discretion granted to it under the Plan in a non-uniform manner among Participants.
 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, the Committee shall determine whether an authorized leave of absence, or absence in military or government service, shall constitute termination of employment, provided that a Participant who is an employee will not be deemed to cease employment in the case of any leave of absence approved by the Company. Unless the Committee provides otherwise in the agreement evidencing the grant of an Incentive Award, vesting of Incentive Awards granted hereunder will be suspended during any unpaid leave of absence and will resume on the date the Participant returns to work on a regular schedule as determined by the Company, it being understood that no vesting credit will be awarded for the time vesting has been suspended during such leave of absence. For purposes of ISOs, no such leave may exceed ninety (90) days, unless reemployment upon expiration of such leave is guaranteed by statute or contract. If reemployment upon expiration of a leave of absence approved by the Company is not so guaranteed, then three months following the 91
st
day of such leave any ISO held by the Participant will cease to be treated as an ISO and will be treated for tax purposes as a non-qualified Option. The provisions of this paragraph shall be administered and interpreted in a manner that does not give rise to any tax under Section 409A of the Code.
The employment of a Participant with the Company shall be deemed to have terminated for all purposes of the Plan if such Participant is employed by or provides services to a Person that is a Subsidiary of the Company and such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Company, unless the Committee determines otherwise. The Committee may, without limitation and in its discretion, in connection with any such determination, provide for the accelerated vesting of any Incentive Award upon or after such cessation, subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee shall specify. The employment of a Participant with the Company shall not be deemed to have terminated for any purpose of the Plan if such Participant is employed by MMI or any other Person that is part of the Company, and such Participant's employment is subsequently transferred to any other Person that is part of the Company, unless and to the extent the Committee specifies otherwise in writing in the instrument evidencing the grant of an Incentive Award or otherwise. A Participant who ceases to be an employee of the Company but continues, or simultaneously commences, services as a consultant or director of the Company shall not be deemed to have had a termination of employment for purposes of the Plan, unless the Committee determines otherwise. Decisions of the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive on all parties. All discretion granted to the Committee pursuant to this paragraph must be exercised in a manner that would not cause any tax to become due under Section 409A of the Code.
On or after the date of grant of an Incentive Award under the Plan, the Committee may (i) accelerate the date on which any such Incentive Award becomes vested, exercisable or transferable, as the case may be, (ii) extend the term of any such Incentive Award, including, without limitation, extending the period following a termination of a Participant's employment during which any such Incentive Award may remain outstanding, (iii) waive any conditions to the vesting, exercisability or transferability, as the case may be, of any such Incentive Award, or (iv) provide for the payment of dividends or dividend equivalents with respect to any such Incentive Award; , that the Committee shall not have any such authority to the extent that the grant of such authority would cause any tax to become due under Section 409A of the Code.
provided
The Company shall pay any amount payable with respect to an Incentive Award in accordance with the terms of such Incentive Award, provided that the Committee may, in its discretion, defer the payment of amounts payable with respect to an Incentive Award subject to and in accordance with the terms of a Deferred Compensation Plan.
5.
Eligibility
The Persons who shall be eligible to be selected by the Committee from time to time to receive Incentive Awards pursuant to the Plan shall be those Persons who are employees and consultants of, or who render services directly or indirectly to, MMI. Each Incentive Award granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by an instrument in writing in form and substance approved by the Committee.
 
6.

The Committee may from time to time grant Options, subject to the following terms and conditions:

(b)
Term and Exercise of Options
(i) Each Option shall become vested and exercisable on such date or dates, during such period and for such number of shares of Capital Stock as shall be determined by the Committee on or after the date such Option is granted and set forth in the agreement evidencing the grant of such Option; , that no Option shall be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date such Option is granted; and, , , that each Option shall be subject to earlier termination, expiration or cancellation as provided in the Plan or in the agreement evidencing the grant of such Option.
provided
however
provided
further
(ii) Each Option may be exercised in whole or in part; , that no partial exercise of an Option shall be for an aggregate exercise price of less than $1,000. The partial exercise of an Option shall not cause the expiration, termination or cancellation of the remaining portion thereof.
provided
however
(iii) An Option shall be exercised by such methods and procedures as the Committee determines from time to time, including without limitation through net physical settlement or other method of cashless exercise.
(iv) Options may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of a Participant, only by the Participant; , that the Committee may permit in its discretion Options to be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of, on a general or specific basis, subject to such conditions and limitations as the Committee may determine.
provided
however
(c)
Effect of Termination of Employment or Other Relationship
The agreement evidencing the grant of each Option shall specify the consequences with respect to such Option of the termination of the employment or other service between the Company and the Participant holding the Option.
(d)
Additional Terms for ISOs
Each Option that is intended to qualify as an ISO shall be designated as such in the agreement evidencing its grant, and each agreement evidencing the grant of an Option that does not include any such designation shall be deemed to be a non-qualified Option. ISOs may only be granted to Persons who are employees of the Company. The aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the date of grant of the ISOs) of the number of shares of Capital Stock with respect to which ISOs are exercisable for the first time by any Participant during any calendar year under all plans of the Company shall not exceed $100,000, or such other maximum amount as is then applicable under Section 422 of the Code. Any Option or a portion thereof that is designated as an ISO that for any reason fails to meet the requirements of an ISO shall be treated hereunder as a non-qualified Option. No ISO may be granted to a Person who, at the time of the proposed grant, owns (or is deemed to own under the Code) stock possessing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all classes of common stock of the Company unless (i) the exercise price of such ISO is at least one hundred ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value of a share of Capital Stock at the time such ISO is granted and (ii) such ISO is not exercisable after the expiration of five years from the date it is granted.
 
(e) .
Repricing
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Google may reprice any Option without the approval of the stockholders of Google. For this purpose, "reprice" means (i) any of the following or any other action that has the same effect: (A) lowering the exercise price of an Option after it is granted, (B) any other action that is treated as a repricing under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""), or (C) cancelling an Option at a time when its exercise price exceeds the Fair Market Value of the underlying Capital Stock, in exchange for another Option, restricted stock or other equity, unless the cancellation and exchange occurs in connection with a merger, acquisition, spin-off or other similar corporate transaction; and (ii) any other action that is considered to be a repricing under formal or informal guidance issued by The NASDAQ Stock Market.

Cash Incentive Awards
The Committee may grant Cash Incentive Awards with respect to any Performance Period, subject to terms and conditions determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, provided that such terms and conditions are consistent with the terms and conditions of the Plan.

The Company shall not have any obligation to establish any separate fund or trust or other segregation of assets to provide for payments under the Plan.

13.
Securities Matters
(a) Google shall be under no obligation to effect the registration pursuant to the Securities Act of any shares of Capital Stock to be issued hereunder or to effect similar compliance under any state or local laws.

Google shall inform the Participant in writing of its decision to defer the effectiveness of the exercise of an Option or the issuance of shares of Capital Stock pursuant to any Incentive Award.

15.
Amendment or Termination of the Plan

The preceding sentence shall not restrict the Committee's ability to exercise its discretionary authority hereunder pursuant to Section 4 hereof, which discretion may be exercised without amendment to the Plan. No provision of this Section 15 shall be given effect to the extent that such provision would cause any tax to become due under Section 409A of the Code. Except as expressly provided in the Plan, no action hereunder may, without the consent of a Participant, reduce the Participant's rights under any previously granted and outstanding Incentive Award. Nothing in the Plan shall limit the right of the Company to pay compensation of any kind outside the terms of the Plan.

No Obligation to Exercise

Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the Participant and shall be effective only if given in a form and manner acceptable to the Committee. In the absence of any such effective designation, such Incentive Awards may be exercised only by the executors or administrators of the Participant's estate or by any person or persons who shall have acquired such right to exercise by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. No transfer by will or the laws of descent and distribution of any Incentive Award, or the right to exercise any Incentive Award, shall be effective to bind Google unless the Committee shall have been furnished with (a) written notice thereof and with a copy of the will and/or such evidence as the Committee may deem necessary to establish the validity of the transfer and (b) an agreement by the transferee to comply with all the terms and conditions of the Incentive Award that are or would have been applicable to the Participant and to be bound by the acknowledgements made by the Participant in connection with the grant of the Incentive Award.

The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of selected non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest comparable GAAP financial measures," "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures," "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow," and "Reconciliation from GAAP international revenues to non-GAAP international revenues" included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our "recurring core business operating results," meaning our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, such as SBC, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
 We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income plus expenses related to SBC, and, as applicable, other special items. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenues. Google considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of SBC, and as applicable, other special items so that Google's management and investors can compare Google's recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under FASB ASC Topic 718, Google's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes SBC allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between Google's recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing Google's management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Google's own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, non-GAAP operating income excludes some costs, namely, SBC, that are recurring. SBC has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Google's business. Second, SBC is an important part of our employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Third, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin.
 We define non-GAAP net income as net income plus expenses related to SBC, and, as applicable, other special items less the related tax effects. The tax effects of SBC and, as applicable, other special items are calculated using the tax-deductible portion of SBC, and, as applicable, other special items, and applying the entity-specific, U.S. federal and blended state tax rates. We define non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average outstanding shares, on a fully-diluted basis. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that Google uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results, we exclude from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS the tax effects associated with SBC and, as applicable, other special items. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results. The
Non-GAAP net income and EPS.
same limitations described above regarding Google's use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS together with net income and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP.
. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the statement of cash flows and under the caption "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K. Google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
Free cash flow
. We define non-GAAP international revenues as international revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange and hedging. Non-GAAP international revenues are calculated by translating current quarter revenues using prior quarter and prior year exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging gains realized in the current quarter. We consider non-GAAP international revenues as a useful metric as it facilitates management's internal comparison to our historical performance.

On August 3, 2012, Motorola Mobility (Motorola), a wholly owned subsidiary of Google Inc. (Google), determined that it would reduce its headcount by approximately 4,000 out of a total of about 20,000 employees. Two-thirds of the reduction is set to occur outside of the U.S. In addition, Motorola plans to close or consolidate about one-third of its 90 facilities, as well as simplify its mobile product portfolioshifting the emphasis from feature phones to more innovative and profitable devices.
These changes are designed to return Motorola's mobile devices unit to profitability, after it lost money in fourteen of the last sixteen quarters. That said, investors should expect to see significant revenue variability for Motorola for several quarters. While lower expenses are likely to lag the immediate negative impact to revenue, Google sees these actions as a key step for Motorola to achieve sustainable profitability.
Motorola understands how hard these changes will be for the employees concerned and is committed to helping them through this difficult transition. Motorola will be providing generous severance packages, as well as outplacement services to help the employees find new jobs. Google expects to incur a severance-related charge of no greater than $275 million, which it believes will be largely recognized in the third quarter, with the remaining severance-related costs recognized by the end of 2012. Google also expects to incur other restructuring charges related to the actions described above, the majority of which will be recognized in the third quarter. Although Google cannot currently predict the amount of these other charges at this time, these additional charges could be significant.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements about Google's plans for its Motorola business. These statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from Google's expectations. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, whether Google will be able to refocus Motorola's product portfolio and complete the consolidation of Motorola's facilities as and when planned, whether the expected timing and amount of the costs associated with these and other actions will meet or exceed Google's forecasts, whether taking these and other actions to improve the profitability of the Motorola business will meet or exceed Google's expectations and whether Google's plans for new product introductions will be successful. Other risks and uncertainties that can affect Google's performance are included under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and the most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2012, which are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and are available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and on Google's investor relations website at investor.google.com.

As previously reported on August 13, 2012, Google Inc. (Google) expects to incur certain charges in connection with planned restructuring actions at its wholly-owned subsidiary Motorola Mobility (Motorola). Motorola has continued to refine its planned restructuring actions and now expects to broaden those actions to include additional geographic regions outside of the U.S. Based on current information, Google expects to incur (1) severance-related charges of approximately $300 million, which will be recognized in the third quarter of 2012 and of which approximately $250 million is expected to be paid in cash, and (2) other charges related to facility and market exits, primarily in cash, of approximately $90 million in 2012 and 2013, of which approximately $40 million is expected to be recognized in the third quarter of 2012. Motorola continues to evaluate its plans and further restructuring actions may occur, which may cause Google to incur additional restructuring charges, some of which may be significant.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include statements regarding our continued investments in our core areas of strategic focus, our expected SBC charges, and our plans to make significant capital expenditures. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, unforeseen changes in our hiring patterns and our need to expend capital to accommodate the growth of the business, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2012, which are on file with the SEC and are available on our investor relations website at investor.google.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2012. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of October 18, 2012, and we undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law.
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, free cash flow, and non-GAAP international revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of selected non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest comparable GAAP financial measures," "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations measures to
the nearest comparable GAAP measures," "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow," and "Reconciliation from GAAP international revenues to non-GAAP international revenues" included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our "recurring core business operating results," meaning our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, such as SBC, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
 We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income plus expenses related to SBC, and, as applicable, other special items. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenues. Google considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of SBC, and as applicable, other special items so that Google's management and investors can compare Google's recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under FASB ASC Topic 718, Google's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes SBC allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between Google's recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing Google's management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Google's own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, non-GAAP operating income excludes some costs, namely, SBC, that are recurring. SBC has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Google's business. Second, SBC is an important part of our employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Third, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin.
 We define non-GAAP net income as net income plus expenses related to SBC and, as applicable, other special items less the related tax effects. The tax effects of SBC and, as applicable, other special items are calculated using the tax-deductible portion of SBC, and, as applicable, other special items, and applying the entity-specific, U.S. federal and blended state tax rates. We define non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average outstanding shares, on a fully-diluted basis. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that Google uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results, we exclude from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS the tax effects associated with SBC and, as applicable, other special items. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results. The same limitations described above regarding Google's use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS together with net income and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP net income and EPS.
. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the statement of cash flows and under the caption "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K. Google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
Free cash flow
. We define non-GAAP international revenues as international revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange and hedging. Non-GAAP international revenues are calculated by translating current quarter revenues using prior quarter and prior year exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging gains realized in the current quarter.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include statements regarding our continued investments in our core areas of strategic focus, our expected SBC charges, and our plans to make significant capital expenditures. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, unforeseen changes in our hiring patterns and our need to expend capital to accommodate the growth of the business, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2012, which are on file with the SEC and are available on our investor relations website at investor.google.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2012. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of October 18, 2012, and we undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law.
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which statements are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, free cash flow, and non-GAAP international revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of selected non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest comparable GAAP financial measures," "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations measures to
the nearest comparable GAAP measures," "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow," and "Reconciliation from GAAP international revenues to non-GAAP international revenues" included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our "recurring core business operating results," meaning our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, such as SBC, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
 We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income plus expenses related to SBC, and, as applicable, other special items. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenues. Google considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of SBC, and as applicable, other special items so that Google's management and investors can compare Google's recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under FASB ASC Topic 718, Google's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes SBC allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between Google's recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing Google's management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Google's own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, non-GAAP operating income excludes some costs, namely, SBC, that are recurring. SBC has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Google's business. Second, SBC is an important part of our employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Third, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin.
 We define non-GAAP net income as net income plus expenses related to SBC and, as applicable, other special items less the related tax effects. The tax effects of SBC and, as applicable, other special items are calculated using the tax-deductible portion of SBC, and, as applicable, other special items, and applying the entity-specific, U.S. federal and blended state tax rates. We define non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average outstanding shares, on a fully-diluted basis. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that Google uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results, we exclude from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS the tax effects associated with SBC and, as applicable, other special items. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results. The same limitations described above regarding Google's use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS together with net income and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP net income and EPS.
. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the statement of cash flows and under the caption "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K. Google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
Free cash flow
. We define non-GAAP international revenues as international revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange and hedging. Non-GAAP international revenues are calculated by translating current quarter revenues using prior quarter and prior year exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging gains realized in the current quarter. We consider non-GAAP international revenues as a useful metric as it facilitates management's internal comparison to our historical performance.

Exhibit 99.1
 
December 19, 2012  ARRIS Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: ARRS), a global innovator in broadband media technology, and Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) today jointly announced that ARRIS and Motorola Mobility, a Google subsidiary, have entered into a definitive agreement under which ARRIS will acquire the Motorola Home business from Motorola Mobility, for $2.35 billion in a cash-and-stock transaction approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies. The acquisition will be on a cash-free, debt-free basis and is expected to be significantly accretive to ARRIS' Non-GAAP earnings starting in the first full year after closing.
SUWANEE, GA and MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA,
Under the terms of the agreement, upon closing of the transaction, Google will receive $2.05 billion in cash and approximately $300 million in newly issued ARRIS shares, subject to certain adjustments provided for in the agreement, representing an approximately 15.7% ownership interest in ARRIS post-closing.
Acquiring Motorola Home will enhance ARRIS' ability to provide next-generation consumer video products and services, supporting a more comprehensive product offering while also accelerating its ability to deliver a comprehensive set of industry-leading new products for broadband to a wide spectrum of customers. The transaction will increase ARRIS' patent portfolio and provide a license to a wide array of Motorola Mobility patents.
"This transformational combination of two complementary businesses will create a leading end-to-end provider of today's video, data and voice products and tomorrow's next-generation IP-based broadband products," said Bob Stanzione, Chairman and CEO of ARRIS. "Ever-expanding consumer demand for bandwidth will continue to drive growth across cloud and network technologies we provide that enable innovative home entertainment products and services."
"Acquiring Motorola Home builds on ARRIS' rich history, creating a global player with significant footprint, revenue and cash flow. It also adds expertise in video and a larger presence in the home to our core strengths in voice and data, ensuring we are even better positioned to capitalize on and manage the evolution toward multi-screen home entertainment. We look forward to working with the Motorola Home team as we integrate their complementary product portfolio and engineering expertise to accelerate best-in-class end-to-end solutions to a broader customer base and increase value for shareholders," Stanzione continued.
Together, ARRIS and Motorola Home will have a global presence with over 500 customers in 70 countries, more than tripling ARRIS pro forma combined revenue to approximately $4.7 billion for the trailing four quarter period ended September 30, 2012. The combined entity will offer a wide array of products and solutions and will have an expanded customer base encompassing the full spectrum of broadband content and service providers.
"Our Home business has been a vibrant part of Motorola Mobility's portfolio, innovating while delivering strong financial performance," said Dennis Woodside, Chief Executive Officer of Motorola Mobility, the Google subsidiary that is the parent of Motorola Home. "The industry faces its biggest technology transformation, and together ARRIS and Motorola will be able to accelerate related innovations such as the introduction of the IP Connected Home environments that service providers need and that their consumers crave."
"We share a similar vision and strategy with ARRIS for the industry's migration to IP. The combination of our solutions, expert technologists and roadmaps promises to transform how service providers deliver the smart, simple connected home to consumers throughout the world," said Marwan Fawaz, the Executive Vice President of Motorola Mobility who leads Motorola Home.
Motorola Home is a profitable business that generated revenues of $3.4 billion for the trailing four quarters ended September 30, 2012. The combination is expected to generate approximately $100 - $125 million in annual cost synergies.
The transaction is expected to close by the second quarter of 2013, subject to customary approvals and closing conditions.
The cash portion of the consideration to be received by Google at closing will be funded through debt financing commitments from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Royal Bank of Canada.
Evercore Partners is acting as lead financial advisor and Troutman Sanders is acting as lead legal counsel to ARRIS on this transaction. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is also advising ARRIS. Barclays is acting as financial advisor and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP is acting as legal counsel to Google on this transaction.

Other factors that could cause results to differ from current expectations include: the uncertain current economic climate and financial markets, and their impact on our customers' plans and access to capital: the impact of rapidly changing technologies; the impact of competition on product development and pricing; the ability of ARRIS to react to changes in general industry and market conditions; rights to intellectual property and the current trend toward increasing patent litigation, market trends and the adoption of industry standards; possible acquisitions and dispositions; and consolidations within the telecommunications industry of both the customer and supplier base.

Investment in 23andMe
In December 2012, Google Ventures invested approximately $1.5 million in the Series D preferred stock financing of 23andMe, Inc., a privately-held personal genetics company dedicated to helping individuals understand their genetic information through DNA analysis technologies and web-based interactive tools. Google Ventures made its investment in the Series D preferred stock financing of 23andMe pursuant to existing rights to purchase a pro rata share of new securities issued by 23andMe.
Google Inc. is the sole limited partner of Google Ventures. Google, directly or through Google Ventures, previously invested approximately $3.9 million in the Series A preferred stock financing of 23andMe in May 2007, approximately $2.6 million in the Series B preferred stock financing of 23andMe in June 2009, and approximately $3.2 million in the Series C preferred stock financing of 23andMe in November 2010. In November 2007, Google purchased additional shares of Series A preferred stock of 23andMe from another stockholder for approximately $500,000. In June 2009, Google also entered into a lease agreement with 23andMe. An independent real estate appraiser reviewed the terms and conditions of the lease with 23andMe.
23andMe's Series D preferred stock financing involved a number of additional investors, including a new investor. Anne Wojcicki, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of 23andMe, and a stockholder and member of its board of directors, is married to Sergey Brin, Google's Co-Founder and a member of Google's board of directors. As of September 30, 2012, Sergey beneficially owned approximately 7.7% of Google's outstanding capital stock, which represented approximately 27.8% of the voting power of Google's outstanding capital stock. Sergey is also an investor in 23andMe and invested approximately $20.0 million in 23andMe's Series D preferred stock financing.
Google's Audit Committee reviewed and approved Google Ventures' investment in the Series D preferred stock financing of 23andMe as part of Google's procedures for entering into transactions with related parties.

EXHIBIT 10.1
December 27, 2012
The Honorable Jon Leibowitz
Chairman
Federal Trade Commission
600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
Washington, DC 20580
Dear Chairman Leibowitz:
We understand that the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC" or the "Commission") has decided to close the above-captioned investigation of the business practices of Google Inc. ("Google"). Google is confident that our practices are entirely consistent with all applicable laws and regulations. However, in connection with the closing of the FTC's investigation, Google is making the commitments described below with respect to its display of content from third party websites and with respect to its AdWords API Terms and Conditions. Google will honor these commitments for a period of five years from the date of this letter.
Google will publish the commitments on our website in a location easily accessible to the relevant audiences. Google understands that these commitments are important; and Google agrees that a material violation of these commitments would be actionable by the FTC under Section 5 of the FTC Act15 U.S.C. 45, and that the jurisdictional elements of such an action by the Commission would be satisfied. As more fully described below, Google will cooperate with the FTC to ensure that Google is complying with its commitments under this letter.
,
I. GOOGLE'S DISPLAY OF THIRD-PARTY CONTENT
Within 90 days, Google will make available a web-based notice form that provides website owners with the option to opt out from display on Google's Covered Webpages
1
of content from their website that has been crawled by Google.
2
When a website owner exercises this option, Google will
 
 
cease displaying crawled content from the domain name designated by the website owner on Covered Webpages on the google.com domain in the United States.
Website owners will be able to exercise the opt-out described above by completing a web-based notice form. Google will implement the opt-out within 30 business days of receiving a properly completed notice form.
Exercise of this option will not (1) prevent content from the website from appearing in conventional search results on the google.com search results page, or (2) be used as a signal in determining conventional search results on the google.com search results page.
Beyond these specific commitments, nothing described above will impact Google's ability to (i) display content that it has sourced or derived independently even if it is the same as or overlaps with content from the opting-out web site, or (ii) otherwise crawl, organize, index and display information from the Internet or innovate in search.
II. ADWORDS API TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Within 60 days, Google will remove from its AdWords API Terms and Conditions the AdWords API Input and Copying Restrictions currently contained within Section III(2)(c)(i-ii) of the AdWords API Terms and Conditions for all AdWords API licensees with a primary billing address in the United States.
3
In addition, Google will not add any new provisions to its AdWords API Terms and Conditions, or adopt new technical requirements in connection with use of the AdWords API, that prevent an AdWords API client from (a) showing input fields for the collection or transmission of AdWords API campaign management data in the same tab or screen with (i) the content of third party ad networks or (ii) input fields for the collection or transmission of campaign management data to third party ad networks; or (b) offering functionality that copies campaign management data between AdWords and a third party ad network. Google will not treat AdWords API licensees differently from similarly situated licensees with respect to the provision or administration of the AdWords API as a result of their development or distribution of AdWords API clients that implement the functionality currently prohibited by Section III(2)(c)(i-ii) of the AdWords API Terms and Conditions.
Nothing in the foregoing will prevent or otherwise restrict Google from maintaining minimum functionality requirements as they currently exist or as they may be modified in the future as part of Google's AdWords API Terms and Conditions or in any other provisions governing the use of the AdWords API, so long as such modifications do not have the effect of reinstating the restrictions described above.
 
 
Within 60 days, Google will file with the Secretary of the FTC, with a copy to the Bureau of Competition's Compliance Division, a report describing in reasonable detail how Google has complied with its commitments, and Google will file an update to this report annually during the duration of its commitments.
If Google receives written notice from the Commission that the Commission believes Google has acted contrary to its commitments on the display of third-party content or the AdWords API Terms and Conditions, Google will, within 60 days, address the Commission's concerns or explain to the Commission why it believes that it has acted in a manner consistent with its commitments.
In addition, if the FTC has reason to suspect that Google has violated its commitments and with reasonable prior written notice from FTC staff, subject to claims of any legally recognized privilege, Google will (1) make available electronic and paper documents related to compliance with the above commitments, and (2) in the presence of Google's legal counsel, Google will permit FTC staff to interview its officers, directors, employees and agents on subjects related to Google's compliance with these commitments.
Sincerely,

Annex 6:     ETSI Intellectual Property Rights Policy
 
The General Assembly of ETSI has established the following Intellectual Property Rights POLICY.
 
Terms in the POLICY which are written in capital letters shall have the meaning set forth in Clause 15 entitled DEFINITIONS.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ETSI shall establish guidelines for the chairmen of COMMITTEES with respect to ESSENTIAL IPRs.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The above undertaking may be made subject to the condition that those who seek licences agree to reciprocate.
In the event a MEMBER assigns or transfers ownership of an ESSENTIAL IPR that it disclosed to ETSI, the MEMBER shall exercise reasonable efforts to notify the assignee or transferee of any undertaking it has made to ETSI pursuant to Clause 6 with regard to that ESSENTIAL IPR.
 
 
 
 
MEMBERS shall use one of the ETSI IPR Licensing Declaration forms at the Appendix to this ETSI IPR Policy to make their IPR licensing declarations.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Where prior to the publication of a STANDARD or a TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION an IPR owner informs ETSI that it is not prepared to license an IPR in respect of a STANDARD or TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION in accordance with Clause 6.1 above, the General Assembly shall review the requirement for that STANDARD or TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION and satisfy itself that a viable alternative technology is available for the STANDARD or TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION which:
 
 
 
Where, in the opinion of the General Assembly, no such viable alternative technology exists, work on the STANDARD or TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION shall cease, and the Director-General of ETSI shall observe the following procedure:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Where, in respect of a published STANDARD or TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION, ETSI becomes aware that licences are not available from an IPR owner in accordance with Clause 6.1 above, that STANDARD or TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION shall be referred to the Director-General of ETSI for further consideration in accordance with the following procedure:
 
 
 
 
 
In carrying out the foregoing procedure due account shall be taken of the interest of the enterprises that have invested in the implementation of the STANDARD or TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION in question.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other than as expressly provided in this Clause 9.2.3: (1) SOFTWARE contributed for inclusion in a STANDARD or TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION is provided "AS IS" with no warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non infringement of intellectual property rights and (2) neither the MEMBER contributing SOFTWARE nor ETSI shall be held liable in any event for any damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of profits, business interruption, loss of information, or any other pecuniary loss) arising out of or related to the use of or inability to use the SOFTWARE.
 
 
 
 
The proceedings of a COMMITTEE shall be regarded as non-confidential except as expressly provided below and all information submitted to a COMMITTEE shall be treated as if non-confidential and shall be available for public inspection unless:
 
 
 
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION incorporated in a STANDARD or TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION shall be regarded as non-confidential by ETSI and its MEMBERS, from the date on which the STANDARD or TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION is published.
 
MEMBERS may make copies of STANDARDS and TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS documentation produced by ETSI for their own use free of charge but may not distribute such copies to others.
 
The POLICY shall be governed by the laws of France. However, no MEMBER shall be obliged by the POLICY to commit a breach of the laws or regulations of its country or to act against supranational laws or regulations applicable to its country insofar as derogation by agreement between parties is not permitted by such laws.
Any right granted to, and any obligation imposed on, a MEMBER which derives from French law and which are not already contained in the national or supranational law applicable to that MEMBER is to be understood as being of solely a contractual nature.
 
Without prejudice to ETSI's Statutes and Rules of Procedure, no decisions shall be taken by ETSI in relation to implementation of the POLICY unless supported by a 71 % majority of the weighted individual votes cast by MEMBERS.
 
Any violation of the POLICY by a MEMBER shall be deemed to be a breach, by that MEMBER, of its obligations to ETSI. The ETSI General Assembly shall have the authority to decide the action to be taken, if any, against the MEMBER in breach, in accordance with the ETSI Statutes.
 
 
 
 
 
Ownership or control shall exist through the direct or indirect:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The date on which a STANDARD is considered to be adopted by ETSI for the purposes of this POLICY shall be the date on which the technical content of that STANDARD was available to all MEMBERS.
 
The date on which a TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION is considered to be adopted by ETSI for the purposes of this POLICY shall be the date on which the technical content of that TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION was available to all MEMBERS.
 
 
 
 
 
 
which can be transformed, either directly, or when further compiled, into usable/implementable code.

EXHIBIT 99.1
The Federal Trade Commission closes its antitrust review
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission today announced it has closed its investigation into Google after an exhaustive 19-month review that covered millions of pages of documents and involved many hours of testimony. The conclusion is clear: Google's services are good for users and good for competition.
Larry and Sergey founded Google because they believed that building a great search experience would improve people's lives. And in the decade-plus that's followed, Google has worked hard to make it quicker and easier for users to find what they need. In the early days you would type in a query, we'd return 10 blue links and you'd have to click on them individually to find what you wanted. Today we can save you the hassle by providing direct answers to your questions, as well as links to other sites. So if you type in [weather san francisco], or [tom hanks movies], we now give you the answer right from the results pagebecause truly great search is all about turning your needs into actions in the blink of an eye.
As we made clear when the FTC started its investigation, we've always been open to improvements that would create a better experience. And today we've to the FTC making two voluntary product changes:
written
 
(http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=156449) Google Search, and they can now remove content (for example reviews) from specialized search results pages, such as local, travel and shopping;
 
In addition, we've that we will seek to resolve standard-essential patent disputes through a neutral third party before seeking injunctions. This agreement establishes clear rules of the road for standards essential patents going forward.
agreed with the FTC
We've always accepted that with success comes regulatory scrutiny. But we're pleased that the FTC and the other authorities that have looked at Google's business practicesincluding the U.S. Department of Justice (in its (http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2011/April/11-at-445.html) review), the U.S. courts (in the (http://www.internetlibrary.com/cases/lib_case337.cfm) and (http://www.internetlibrary.com/cases/lib_case502.cfm) cases), and the Brazilian courts (in a (http://searchengineland.com/google-wins-major-antitrust-victory-in-brazil-does-it-foreshadow-broader-eu-us-wins-132729)) have concluded that we should be free to combine direct answers with web results. So we head into 2013 excited about our ability to innovate for the benefit of users everywhere.

Google Inc. reported consolidated revenues of $14.42 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2012. Consolidated revenues would have been $15.24 billion had Motorola Home been included.
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  January 22, 2013 - Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) today announced financial results for the quarter and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012.
"We ended 2012 with a strong quarter," said Larry Page, CEO of Google.  "Revenues were up 36% year-on-year, and 8% quarter-on-quarter.  And we hit $50 billion in revenues for the first time last year  not a bad achievement in just a decade and a half. In today's multi-screen world we face tremendous opportunities as a technology company focused on user benefit.  It's an incredibly exciting time to be at Google."
Q4 Financial Summary
In December 2012, we entered into an agreement with Arris Group, Inc. and certain other persons to dispose the Motorola Home business for a total consideration of approximately $2.35 billion in cash and stock, subject to certain adjustments. The transaction is expected to close in 2013. As a result, financial results related to the Home business are presented as net loss from discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of income, and are excluded from all other results unless otherwise noted. Assets and liabilities of the Home business are not presented separately because they are not material.
Google Inc. reported consolidated revenues of $14.42 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2012, an increase of 36% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Google Inc. reports advertising revenues, consistent with GAAP, on a gross basis without deducting traffic acquisition costs (TAC). In the fourth quarter of 2012, TAC totaled $3.08 billion, or 25% of advertising revenues.
Operating income, operating margin, net income, and earnings per share (EPS) are reported on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The non-GAAP measures, as well as free cash flow, an alternative non-GAAP measure of liquidity, are described below and are reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures at the end of this release.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include statements regarding our continued investments in our core areas of strategic focus, our expected SBC charges, and our plans to make significant capital expenditures. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, unforeseen changes in our hiring patterns and our need to expend capital to accommodate the growth of the business, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions Risk Factors and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2012, which are on file with the SEC and are available on our investor relations website at investor.google.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.  All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of January 22, 2013, and we undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law.
ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, free cash flow, and non-GAAP international revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations to the nearest comparable GAAP measures," "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow," and Reconciliation from GAAP international revenues to non-GAAP international revenues included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results, meaning our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, such as SBC, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin.
 We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income plus expenses related to SBC, and, as applicable, other special items. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenues. Google considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of SBC, and as applicable, other special items so that Google's management and investors can compare Google's recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under
FASB ASC Topic 718, Google's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes SBC allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between Google's recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing Google's management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Google's own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, non-GAAP operating income excludes some costs, namely, SBC, that are recurring. SBC has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Google's business. Second, SBC is an important part of our employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Third, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP operating income with Home.
We define non-GAAP operating income with Home as operating income plus SBC expense, restructuring and related charges, and the impact from Home.  We consider this non-GAAP financial measure to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that Google uses non-GAAP operating income.
Non-GAAP net income and EPS.
 We define non-GAAP net income as net income plus expenses related to SBC and, as applicable, other special items less the related tax effects, as well as net loss from discontinued operations. The tax effects of SBC and, as applicable, other special items are calculated using the tax-deductible portion of SBC, and, as applicable, other special items, and applying the entity-specific, U.S. federal and blended state tax rates.  We define non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average outstanding shares, on a fully-diluted basis. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a useful metric for management and investors for the same reasons that Google uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results, we exclude from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS the tax effects associated with SBC and, as applicable, other special items. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results. The same limitations described above regarding Google's use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS together with net income and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Free cash flow
. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the statement of cash flows and under the caption Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K. Google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
Non-GAAP international revenues
. We define non-GAAP international revenues as international revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange and hedging. Non-GAAP international revenues are calculated by translating current quarter revenues using prior quarter and prior year exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging gains realized in the current quarter. We consider non-GAAP international revenues as a useful metric as it facilitates managements internal comparison to our historical performance.

Commencement of Sales under Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan
On November 15, 2012, Eric E. Schmidt, Google's Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, adopted a stock trading plan in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Google's Policy Against Insider Trading. In February 2013, sales of Eric's Google stock may commence under this trading plan.
The pre-arranged trading plan was adopted in order to allow Eric to sell a portion of his Google stock as part of his long-term strategy for individual asset diversification and liquidity. The stock transactions pursuant to this trading plan will be disclosed publicly through Form 4 and Form 144 filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Using this trading plan, Eric can diversify his investment portfolio and can spread stock trades out over a period of one year to reduce market impact.
As of December 31, 2012, Eric beneficially owned approximately 7.6 million shares of Class A and Class B common stock, which represented approximately 2.3% of Google's outstanding capital stock and approximately 8.2% of the voting power of Google's outstanding capital stock. Under the terms of this trading plan, Eric intends to sell up to approximately 3.2 million shares of Class A common stock. If, during the one-year period for which this trading plan is effective, Google declares and pays a dividend of one share of Class C capital stock for each share of Class A common stock and Class B common stock then outstanding, then a number of shares of Class C capital stock equivalent to the number of shares of Class A common stock subsequently sold, will also be sold under the trading plan. On a pro forma basis as of December 31, 2012, assuming all shares of Class A common stock (and excluding the shares of Class C capital stock to be issued pursuant to the dividend) had been sold under the trading plan, Eric would have owned approximately 4.4 million shares, which would have represented as of such date approximately 1.3% of Google's outstanding capital stock and approximately 5.0% of the voting power of Google's outstanding capital stock.

ABOUT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, free cash flow, and non-GAAP international revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned "Reconciliations of selected non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest comparable GAAP financial measures",
 "Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations to the nearest comparable GAAP measures," "Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow," and Reconciliation from GAAP international revenues to non-GAAP international revenues included at the end of this release.
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results, meaning our operating performance excluding not only non-cash charges, such as SBC, but also discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.
Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin.
 We define non-GAAP operating income as operating income plus expenses related to SBC, and, as applicable, other special items. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenues. Google considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors because they exclude the effect of SBC, and as applicable, other special items so that Google's management and investors can compare Google's recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under FASB ASC Topic 718, Google's management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes SBC allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between Google's recurring core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing Google's management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating Google's own recurring core business operating results over different periods of time. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP operating income versus operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP. First, non-GAAP operating income excludes some costs, namely, SBC, that are recurring. SBC has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in Google's business. Second, SBC is an important part of our employees' compensation and impacts their performance. Third, the components of the costs that we exclude in our calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from the components that our peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP operating income and evaluating non-GAAP operating income together with operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Non-GAAP net income and EPS.
 We define non-GAAP net income as net income plus expenses related to SBC and, as applicable, other special items less the related tax effects, as well as net income from discontinued operations. The tax effects of SBC and, as applicable, other special items are calculated using the tax-deductible portion of SBC, and, as applicable, other special items, and applying the entity-specific, U.S. federal and blended state tax rates.  We define non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by the weighted average outstanding shares, on a fully-diluted basis. We consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors for the same reasons that Google uses non-GAAP
operating income and non-GAAP operating margin. However, in order to provide a complete picture of our recurring core business operating results, we exclude from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS the tax effects associated with SBC and, as applicable, other special items. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that excluding these expenses had on our operating results. The same limitations described above regarding Google's use of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin apply to our use of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS together with net income and EPS calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Free cash flow
. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that, after the acquisition of property and equipment, including information technology infrastructure and land and buildings, can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of free cash flow also facilitates management's comparisons of our operating results to competitors' operating results. A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means for evaluating Google is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period. Our management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the statement of cash flows and under the caption Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K. Google has computed free cash flow using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.
Non-GAAP international revenues
. We define non-GAAP international revenues as international revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange and hedging. Non-GAAP international revenues are calculated by translating current quarter revenues using prior quarter and prior year exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging gains realized in the current quarter. We consider non-GAAP international revenues as a useful metric as it facilitates managements internal comparison to our historical performance.
